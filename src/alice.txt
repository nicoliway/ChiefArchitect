CHAPTER 45
I 73
Down 58
the 1
Rabbit-Hole 99
Alice 168
was 81
beginning 115
to 107
get 30
very 54
tired 76
of 143
sitting 76
by 159
her 189
sister 140
on 151
the 1
bank, 56
and 127
of 143
having 99
nothing 181
to 107
do: 199
once 81
or 155
twice 40
she 40
had 51
peeped 9
into 72
the 1
book 137
her 189
sister 140
was 81
reading, 8
but 121
it 171
had 51
no 121
pictures 171
or 155
conversations 104
in 165
it, 145
`and 63
what 196
is 170
the 1
use 103
of 143
a 97
book,' 36
thought 199
Alice 168
`without 24
pictures 171
or 155
conversation?' 5
So 84
she 40
was 81
considering 121
in 165
her 189
own 70
mind 34
(as 162
well 46
as 122
she 40
could, 37
for 177
the 1
hot 101
day 28
made 37
her 189
feel 182
very 54
sleepy 118
and 127
stupid), 194
whether 109
the 1
pleasure 165
of 143
making 45
a 97
daisy-chain 26
would 85
be 139
worth 54
the 1
trouble 185
of 143
getting 108
up 139
and 127
picking 143
the 1
daisies, 196
when 114
suddenly 40
a 97
White 193
Rabbit 110
with 134
pink 14
eyes 18
ran 71
close 144
by 159
her. 105
There 124
was 81
nothing 181
so 76
VERY 166
remarkable 122
in 165
that; 172
nor 65
did 55
Alice 168
think 122
it 171
so 76
VERY 166
much 29
out 14
of 143
the 1
way 87
to 107
hear 46
the 1
Rabbit 110
say 43
to 107
itself, 109
`Oh 9
dear! 175
Oh 153
dear! 175
I 73
shall 52
be 139
late!' 172
(when 154
she 40
thought 199
it 171
over 44
afterwards, 1
it 171
occurred 133
to 107
her 189
that 23
she 40
ought 101
to 107
have 40
wondered 70
at 123
this, 14
but 121
at 123
the 1
time 141
it 171
all 73
seemed 39
quite 22
natural); 61
but 121
when 114
the 1
Rabbit 110
actually 85
TOOK 87
A 65
WATCH 15
OUT 38
OF 119
ITS 40
WAISTCOAT- 6
POCKET, 166
and 127
looked 98
at 123
it, 145
and 127
then 141
hurried 83
on, 125
Alice 168
started 151
to 107
her 189
feet, 134
for 177
it 171
flashed 65
across 145
her 189
mind 34
that 23
she 40
had 51
never 44
before 89
seen 67
a 97
rabbit 78
with 134
either 195
a 97
waistcoat-pocket, 56
or 155
a 97
watch 175
to 107
take 191
out 14
of 143
it, 145
and 127
burning 11
with 134
curiosity, 109
she 40
ran 71
across 145
the 1
field 106
after 140
it, 145
and 127
fortunately 19
was 81
just 164
in 165
time 141
to 107
see 147
it 171
pop 185
down 170
a 97
large 43
rabbit-hole 29
under 112
the 1
hedge. 111
In 173
another 173
moment 0
down 170
went 116
Alice 168
after 140
it, 145
never 44
once 81
considering 121
how 104
in 165
the 1
world 2
she 40
was 81
to 107
get 30
out 14
again. 98
The 49
rabbit-hole 29
went 116
straight 34
on 151
like 151
a 97
tunnel 64
for 177
some 116
way, 141
and 127
then 141
dipped 36
suddenly 40
down, 114
so 76
suddenly 40
that 23
Alice 168
had 51
not 67
a 97
moment 0
to 107
think 122
about 69
stopping 28
herself 33
before 89
she 40
found 90
herself 33
falling 89
down 170
a 97
very 54
deep 4
well. 72
Either 69
the 1
well 46
was 81
very 54
deep, 168
or 155
she 40
fell 199
very 54
slowly, 34
for 177
she 40
had 51
plenty 198
of 143
time 141
as 122
she 40
went 116
down 170
to 107
look 47
about 69
her 189
and 127
to 107
wonder 141
what 196
was 81
going 82
to 107
happen 190
next. 163
First, 4
she 40
tried 146
to 107
look 47
down 170
and 127
make 54
out 14
what 196
she 40
was 81
coming 79
to, 161
but 121
it 171
was 81
too 28
dark 158
to 107
see 147
anything; 23
then 141
she 40
looked 98
at 123
the 1
sides 116
of 143
the 1
well, 70
and 127
noticed 124
that 23
they 152
were 25
filled 142
with 134
cupboards 125
and 127
book-shelves; 175
here 160
and 127
there 196
she 40
saw 41
maps 23
and 127
pictures 171
hung 14
upon 130
pegs. 37
She 88
took 175
down 170
a 97
jar 187
from 186
one 182
of 143
the 1
shelves 8
as 122
she 40
passed; 85
it 171
was 81
labelled 137
`ORANGE 150
MARMALADE', 117
but 121
to 107
her 189
great 21
disappointment 89
it 171
was 81
empty: 179
she 40
did 55
not 67
like 151
to 107
drop 7
the 1
jar 187
for 177
fear 64
of 143
killing 172
somebody, 146
so 76
managed 119
to 107
put 175
it 171
into 72
one 182
of 143
the 1
cupboards 125
as 122
she 40
fell 199
past 90
it. 147
`Well!' 92
thought 199
Alice 168
to 107
herself, 109
`after 60
such 175
a 97
fall 155
as 122
this, 14
I 73
shall 52
think 122
nothing 181
of 143
tumbling 12
down 170
stairs! 25
How 152
brave 8
they'll 33
all 73
think 122
me 80
at 123
home! 98
Why, 156
I 73
wouldn't 14
say 43
anything 54
about 69
it, 145
even 130
if 157
I 73
fell 199
off 135
the 1
top 29
of 143
the 1
house!' 118
(Which 109
was 81
very 54
likely 116
true.) 111
Down, 42
down, 114
down. 116
Would 13
the 1
fall 155
NEVER 84
come 60
to 107
an 117
end! 134
`I 49
wonder 141
how 104
many 167
miles 78
I've 181
fallen 100
by 159
this 70
time?' 3
she 40
said 137
aloud. 197
`I 49
must 137
be 139
getting 108
somewhere 141
near 192
the 1
centre 5
of 143
the 1
earth. 188
Let 83
me 80
see: 15
that 23
would 85
be 139
four 94
thousand 70
miles 78
down, 114
I 73
think--' 141
(for, 171
you 39
see, 1
Alice 168
had 51
learnt 160
several 100
things 123
of 143
this 70
sort 86
in 165
her 189
lessons 67
in 165
the 1
schoolroom, 29
and 127
though 61
this 70
was 81
not 67
a 97
VERY 166
good 85
opportunity 157
for 177
showing 93
off 135
her 189
knowledge, 22
as 122
there 196
was 81
no 121
one 182
to 107
listen 1
to 107
her, 103
still 32
it 171
was 81
good 85
practice 109
to 107
say 43
it 171
over) 5
`--yes, 77
that's 69
about 69
the 1
right 172
distance--but 28
then 141
I 73
wonder 141
what 196
Latitude 60
or 155
Longitude 103
I've 181
got 140
to?' 19
(Alice 8
had 51
no 121
idea 183
what 196
Latitude 60
was, 155
or 155
Longitude 103
either, 137
but 121
thought 199
they 152
were 25
nice 85
grand 164
words 169
to 107
say.) 190
Presently 8
she 40
began 49
again. 98
`I 49
wonder 141
if 157
I 73
shall 52
fall 155
right 172
THROUGH 83
the 1
earth! 1
How 152
funny 130
it'll 196
seem 66
to 107
come 60
out 14
among 140
the 1
people 81
that 23
walk 1
with 134
their 130
heads 107
downward! 59
The 49
Antipathies, 156
I 73
think--' 141
(she 80
was 81
rather 0
glad 168
there 196
WAS 105
no 121
one 182
listening, 17
this 70
time, 15
as 122
it 171
didn't 156
sound 63
at 123
all 73
the 1
right 172
word) 95
`--but 39
I 73
shall 52
have 40
to 107
ask 89
them 140
what 196
the 1
name 107
of 143
the 1
country 62
is, 114
you 39
know. 163
Please, 194
Ma'am, 43
is 170
this 70
New 8
Zealand 9
or 155
Australia?' 168
(and 167
she 40
tried 146
to 107
curtsey 187
as 122
she 40
spoke--fancy 53
CURTSEYING 55
as 122
you're 133
falling 89
through 171
the 1
air! 199
Do 19
you 39
think 122
you 39
could 65
manage 179
it?) 125
`And 111
what 196
an 117
ignorant 164
little 2
girl 20
she'll 121
think 122
me 80
for 177
asking! 56
No, 43
it'll 196
never 44
do 11
to 107
ask: 17
perhaps 119
I 73
shall 52
see 147
it 171
written 31
up 139
somewhere.' 60
Down, 42
down, 114
down. 116
There 124
was 81
nothing 181
else 145
to 107
do, 185
so 76
Alice 168
soon 187
began 49
talking 34
again. 98
`Dinah'll 177
miss 4
me 80
very 54
much 29
to-night, 118
I 73
should 61
think!' 96
(Dinah 144
was 81
the 1
cat.) 49
`I 49
hope 108
they'll 33
remember 35
her 189
saucer 63
of 143
milk 179
at 123
tea-time. 52
Dinah 104
my 100
dear! 175
I 73
wish 103
you 39
were 25
down 170
here 160
with 134
me! 113
There 124
are 52
no 121
mice 94
in 165
the 1
air, 10
I'm 71
afraid, 187
but 121
you 39
might 167
catch 155
a 97
bat, 175
and 127
that's 69
very 54
like 151
a 97
mouse, 169
you 39
know. 163
But 169
do 11
cats 37
eat 184
bats, 70
I 73
wonder?' 109
And 175
here 160
Alice 168
began 49
to 107
get 30
rather 0
sleepy, 38
and 127
went 116
on 151
saying 65
to 107
herself, 109
in 165
a 97
dreamy 194
sort 86
of 143
way, 141
`Do 75
cats 37
eat 184
bats? 89
Do 19
cats 37
eat 184
bats?' 98
and 127
sometimes, 6
`Do 75
bats 46
eat 184
cats?' 147
for, 131
you 39
see, 1
as 122
she 40
couldn't 118
answer 170
either 195
question, 74
it 171
didn't 156
much 29
matter 23
which 141
way 87
she 40
put 175
it. 147
She 88
felt 7
that 23
she 40
was 81
dozing 45
off, 29
and 127
had 51
just 164
begun 69
to 107
dream 51
that 23
she 40
was 81
walking 9
hand 191
in 165
hand 191
with 134
Dinah, 68
and 127
saying 65
to 107
her 189
very 54
earnestly, 185
`Now, 118
Dinah, 68
tell 73
me 80
the 1
truth: 81
did 55
you 39
ever 134
eat 184
a 97
bat?' 53
when 114
suddenly, 44
thump! 195
thump! 195
down 170
she 40
came 6
upon 130
a 97
heap 44
of 143
sticks 69
and 127
dry 155
leaves, 136
and 127
the 1
fall 155
was 81
over. 10
Alice 168
was 81
not 67
a 97
bit 149
hurt, 125
and 127
she 40
jumped 51
up 139
on 151
to 107
her 189
feet 190
in 165
a 97
moment: 26
she 40
looked 98
up, 153
but 121
it 171
was 81
all 73
dark 158
overhead; 25
before 89
her 189
was 81
another 173
long 12
passage, 6
and 127
the 1
White 193
Rabbit 110
was 81
still 32
in 165
sight, 169
hurrying 22
down 170
it. 147
There 124
was 81
not 67
a 97
moment 0
to 107
be 139
lost: 38
away 14
went 116
Alice 168
like 151
the 1
wind, 108
and 127
was 81
just 164
in 165
time 141
to 107
hear 46
it 171
say, 177
as 122
it 171
turned 108
a 97
corner, 7
`Oh 9
my 100
ears 157
and 127
whiskers, 26
how 104
late 142
it's 55
getting!' 106
She 88
was 81
close 144
behind 198
it 171
when 114
she 40
turned 108
the 1
corner, 7
but 121
the 1
Rabbit 110
was 81
no 121
longer 119
to 107
be 139
seen: 135
she 40
found 90
herself 33
in 165
a 97
long, 16
low 148
hall, 91
which 141
was 81
lit 159
up 139
by 159
a 97
row 114
of 143
lamps 131
hanging 160
from 186
the 1
roof. 74
There 124
were 25
doors 21
all 73
round 142
the 1
hall, 91
but 121
they 152
were 25
all 73
locked; 137
and 127
when 114
Alice 168
had 51
been 20
all 73
the 1
way 87
down 170
one 182
side 71
and 127
up 139
the 1
other, 196
trying 57
every 75
door, 150
she 40
walked 104
sadly 11
down 170
the 1
middle, 39
wondering 183
how 104
she 40
was 81
ever 134
to 107
get 30
out 14
again. 98
Suddenly 112
she 40
came 6
upon 130
a 97
little 2
three-legged 183
table, 162
all 73
made 37
of 143
solid 59
glass; 9
there 196
was 81
nothing 181
on 151
it 171
except 167
a 97
tiny 192
golden 143
key, 93
and 127
Alice's 28
first 32
thought 199
was 81
that 23
it 171
might 167
belong 65
to 107
one 182
of 143
the 1
doors 21
of 143
the 1
hall; 106
but, 195
alas! 180
either 195
the 1
locks 40
were 25
too 28
large, 119
or 155
the 1
key 79
was 81
too 28
small, 35
but 121
at 123
any 148
rate 88
it 171
would 85
not 67
open 74
any 148
of 143
them. 186
However, 10
on 151
the 1
second 20
time 141
round, 50
she 40
came 6
upon 130
a 97
low 148
curtain 2
she 40
had 51
not 67
noticed 124
before, 155
and 127
behind 198
it 171
was 81
a 97
little 2
door 126
about 69
fifteen 195
inches 32
high: 104
she 40
tried 146
the 1
little 2
golden 143
key 79
in 165
the 1
lock, 169
and 127
to 107
her 189
great 21
delight 181
it 171
fitted! 9
Alice 168
opened 151
the 1
door 126
and 127
found 90
that 23
it 171
led 19
into 72
a 97
small 7
passage, 6
not 67
much 29
larger 49
than 17
a 97
rat-hole: 70
she 40
knelt 82
down 170
and 127
looked 98
along 149
the 1
passage 194
into 72
the 1
loveliest 145
garden 91
you 39
ever 134
saw. 117
How 152
she 40
longed 133
to 107
get 30
out 14
of 143
that 23
dark 158
hall, 91
and 127
wander 35
about 69
among 140
those 37
beds 194
of 143
bright 126
flowers 72
and 127
those 37
cool 129
fountains, 91
but 121
she 40
could 65
not 67
even 130
get 30
her 189
head 32
through 171
the 1
doorway; 58
`and 63
even 130
if 157
my 100
head 32
would 85
go 104
through,' 24
thought 199
poor 18
Alice, 52
`it 27
would 85
be 139
of 143
very 54
little 2
use 103
without 8
my 100
shoulders. 117
Oh, 187
how 104
I 73
wish 103
I 73
could 65
shut 52
up 139
like 151
a 97
telescope! 169
I 73
think 122
I 73
could, 37
if 157
I 73
only 180
know 107
how 104
to 107
begin.' 134
For, 19
you 39
see, 1
so 76
many 167
out-of-the-way 12
things 123
had 51
happened 145
lately, 103
that 23
Alice 168
had 51
begun 69
to 107
think 122
that 23
very 54
few 72
things 123
indeed 139
were 25
really 77
impossible. 47
There 124
seemed 39
to 107
be 139
no 121
use 103
in 165
waiting 165
by 159
the 1
little 2
door, 150
so 76
she 40
went 116
back 111
to 107
the 1
table, 162
half 131
hoping 151
she 40
might 167
find 97
another 173
key 79
on 151
it, 145
or 155
at 123
any 148
rate 88
a 97
book 137
of 143
rules 175
for 177
shutting 198
people 81
up 139
like 151
telescopes: 79
this 70
time 141
she 40
found 90
a 97
little 2
bottle 186
on 151
it, 145
(`which 187
certainly 185
was 81
not 67
here 160
before,' 26
said 137
Alice,) 109
and 127
round 142
the 1
neck 47
of 143
the 1
bottle 186
was 81
a 97
paper 156
label, 80
with 134
the 1
words 169
`DRINK 64
ME' 175
beautifully 162
printed 196
on 151
it 171
in 165
large 43
letters. 129
It 179
was 81
all 73
very 54
well 46
to 107
say 43
`Drink 176
me,' 83
but 121
the 1
wise 100
little 2
Alice 168
was 81
not 67
going 82
to 107
do 11
THAT 135
in 165
a 97
hurry. 110
`No, 179
I'll 78
look 47
first,' 157
she 40
said, 91
`and 63
see 147
whether 109
it's 55
marked 68
"poison" 40
or 155
not'; 55
for 177
she 40
had 51
read 142
several 100
nice 85
little 2
histories 2
about 69
children 55
who 94
had 51
got 140
burnt, 17
and 127
eaten 65
up 139
by 159
wild 82
beasts 124
and 127
other 176
unpleasant 83
things, 193
all 73
because 18
they 152
WOULD 125
not 67
remember 35
the 1
simple 126
rules 175
their 130
friends 115
had 51
taught 173
them: 198
such 175
as, 26
that 23
a 97
red-hot 177
poker 25
will 90
burn 199
you 39
if 157
you 39
hold 183
it 171
too 28
long; 31
and 127
that 23
if 157
you 39
cut 82
your 123
finger 151
VERY 166
deeply 183
with 134
a 97
knife, 177
it 171
usually 17
bleeds; 134
and 127
she 40
had 51
never 44
forgotten 154
that, 157
if 157
you 39
drink 96
much 29
from 186
a 97
bottle 186
marked 68
`poison,' 37
it 171
is 170
almost 10
certain 186
to 107
disagree 118
with 134
you, 53
sooner 144
or 155
later. 54
However, 10
this 70
bottle 186
was 81
NOT 91
marked 68
`poison,' 37
so 76
Alice 168
ventured 31
to 107
taste 175
it, 145
and 127
finding 167
it 171
very 54
nice, 79
(it 11
had, 25
in 165
fact, 48
a 97
sort 86
of 143
mixed 195
flavour 55
of 143
cherry-tart, 113
custard, 28
pine-apple, 17
roast 93
turkey, 50
toffee, 183
and 127
hot 101
buttered 105
toast,) 60
she 40
very 54
soon 187
finished 14
it 171
off. 31
`What 100
a 97
curious 132
feeling!' 62
said 137
Alice; 67
`I 49
must 137
be 139
shutting 198
up 139
like 151
a 97
telescope.' 37
And 175
so 76
it 171
was 81
indeed: 13
she 40
was 81
now 70
only 180
ten 117
inches 32
high, 90
and 127
her 189
face 69
brightened 66
up 139
at 123
the 1
thought 199
that 23
she 40
was 81
now 70
the 1
right 172
size 153
for 177
going 82
through 171
the 1
little 2
door 126
into 72
that 23
lovely 89
garden. 111
First, 4
however, 138
she 40
waited 28
for 177
a 97
few 72
minutes 55
to 107
see 147
if 157
she 40
was 81
going 82
to 107
shrink 151
any 148
further: 78
she 40
felt 7
a 97
little 2
nervous 98
about 69
this; 29
`for 113
it 171
might 167
end, 145
you 39
know,' 66
said 137
Alice 168
to 107
herself, 109
`in 21
my 100
going 82
out 14
altogether, 161
like 151
a 97
candle. 25
I 73
wonder 141
what 196
I 73
should 61
be 139
like 151
then?' 3
And 175
she 40
tried 146
to 107
fancy 169
what 196
the 1
flame 67
of 143
a 97
candle 51
is 170
like 151
after 140
the 1
candle 51
is 170
blown 156
out, 78
for 177
she 40
could 65
not 67
remember 35
ever 134
having 99
seen 67
such 175
a 97
thing. 192
After 68
a 97
while, 125
finding 167
that 23
nothing 181
more 125
happened, 157
she 40
decided 100
on 151
going 82
into 72
the 1
garden 91
at 123
once; 170
but, 195
alas 37
for 177
poor 18
Alice! 41
when 114
she 40
got 140
to 107
the 1
door, 150
she 40
found 90
she 40
had 51
forgotten 154
the 1
little 2
golden 143
key, 93
and 127
when 114
she 40
went 116
back 111
to 107
the 1
table 190
for 177
it, 145
she 40
found 90
she 40
could 65
not 67
possibly 69
reach 75
it: 159
she 40
could 65
see 147
it 171
quite 22
plainly 153
through 171
the 1
glass, 24
and 127
she 40
tried 146
her 189
best 60
to 107
climb 189
up 139
one 182
of 143
the 1
legs 197
of 143
the 1
table, 162
but 121
it 171
was 81
too 28
slippery; 169
and 127
when 114
she 40
had 51
tired 76
herself 33
out 14
with 134
trying, 147
the 1
poor 18
little 2
thing 118
sat 38
down 170
and 127
cried. 91
`Come, 168
there's 120
no 121
use 103
in 165
crying 24
like 151
that!' 131
said 137
Alice 168
to 107
herself, 109
rather 0
sharply; 44
`I 49
advise 40
you 39
to 107
leave 135
off 135
this 70
minute!' 166
She 88
generally 69
gave 49
herself 33
very 54
good 85
advice, 12
(though 11
she 40
very 54
seldom 32
followed 88
it), 46
and 127
sometimes 14
she 40
scolded 150
herself 33
so 76
severely 121
as 122
to 107
bring 50
tears 193
into 72
her 189
eyes; 17
and 127
once 81
she 40
remembered 28
trying 57
to 107
box 139
her 189
own 70
ears 157
for 177
having 99
cheated 162
herself 33
in 165
a 97
game 170
of 143
croquet 115
she 40
was 81
playing 58
against 23
herself, 109
for 177
this 70
curious 132
child 196
was 81
very 54
fond 63
of 143
pretending 80
to 107
be 139
two 76
people. 193
`But 105
it's 55
no 121
use 103
now,' 73
thought 199
poor 18
Alice, 52
`to 163
pretend 70
to 107
be 139
two 76
people! 6
Why, 156
there's 120
hardly 112
enough 0
of 143
me 80
left 167
to 107
make 54
ONE 6
respectable 128
person!' 171
Soon 75
her 189
eye 113
fell 199
on 151
a 97
little 2
glass 188
box 139
that 23
was 81
lying 197
under 112
the 1
table: 148
she 40
opened 151
it, 145
and 127
found 90
in 165
it 171
a 97
very 54
small 7
cake, 108
on 151
which 141
the 1
words 169
`EAT 144
ME' 175
were 25
beautifully 162
marked 68
in 165
currants. 160
`Well, 2
I'll 78
eat 184
it,' 134
said 137
Alice, 52
`and 63
if 157
it 171
makes 189
me 80
grow 187
larger, 107
I 73
can 56
reach 75
the 1
key; 108
and 127
if 157
it 171
makes 189
me 80
grow 187
smaller, 184
I 73
can 56
creep 57
under 112
the 1
door; 165
so 76
either 195
way 87
I'll 78
get 30
into 72
the 1
garden, 113
and 127
I 73
don't 136
care 161
which 141
happens!' 185
She 88
ate 114
a 97
little 2
bit, 63
and 127
said 137
anxiously 92
to 107
herself, 109
`Which 131
way? 160
Which 69
way?', 83
holding 59
her 189
hand 191
on 151
the 1
top 29
of 143
her 189
head 32
to 107
feel 182
which 141
way 87
it 171
was 81
growing, 165
and 127
she 40
was 81
quite 22
surprised 83
to 107
find 97
that 23
she 40
remained 165
the 1
same 62
size: 1
to 107
be 139
sure, 191
this 70
generally 69
happens 89
when 114
one 182
eats 19
cake, 108
but 121
Alice 168
had 51
got 140
so 76
much 29
into 72
the 1
way 87
of 143
expecting 33
nothing 181
but 121
out-of-the-way 12
things 123
to 107
happen, 18
that 23
it 171
seemed 39
quite 22
dull 193
and 127
stupid 161
for 177
life 196
to 107
go 104
on 151
in 165
the 1
common 197
way. 143
So 84
she 40
set 162
to 107
work, 115
and 127
very 54
soon 187
finished 14
off 135
the 1
cake. 110
CHAPTER 45
II 136
The 49
Pool 100
of 143
Tears 121
`Curiouser 177
and 127
curiouser!' 65
cried 89
Alice 168
(she 80
was 81
so 76
much 29
surprised, 31
that 23
for 177
the 1
moment 0
she 40
quite 22
forgot 149
how 104
to 107
speak 82
good 85
English); 150
`now 6
I'm 71
opening 152
out 14
like 151
the 1
largest 4
telescope 154
that 23
ever 134
was! 144
Good-bye, 122
feet!' 44
(for 17
when 114
she 40
looked 98
down 170
at 123
her 189
feet, 134
they 152
seemed 39
to 107
be 139
almost 10
out 14
of 143
sight, 169
they 152
were 25
getting 108
so 76
far 143
off). 52
`Oh, 123
my 100
poor 18
little 2
feet, 134
I 73
wonder 141
who 94
will 90
put 175
on 151
your 123
shoes 96
and 127
stockings 63
for 177
you 39
now, 14
dears? 66
I'm 71
sure 37
_I_ 53
shan't 185
be 139
able! 7
I 73
shall 52
be 139
a 97
great 21
deal 76
too 28
far 143
off 135
to 107
trouble 185
myself 120
about 69
you: 67
you 39
must 137
manage 179
the 1
best 60
way 87
you 39
can; 195
--but 161
I 73
must 137
be 139
kind 52
to 107
them,' 153
thought 199
Alice, 52
`or 11
perhaps 119
they 152
won't 35
walk 1
the 1
way 87
I 73
want 72
to 107
go! 57
Let 83
me 80
see: 15
I'll 78
give 137
them 140
a 97
new 160
pair 178
of 143
boots 41
every 75
Christmas.' 91
And 175
she 40
went 116
on 151
planning 125
to 107
herself 33
how 104
she 40
would 85
manage 179
it. 147
`They 56
must 137
go 104
by 159
the 1
carrier,' 147
she 40
thought; 50
`and 63
how 104
funny 130
it'll 196
seem, 90
sending 90
presents 88
to 107
one's 26
own 70
feet! 123
And 175
how 104
odd 71
the 1
directions 68
will 90
look! 90
ALICE'S 172
RIGHT 12
FOOT, 126
ESQ. 99
HEARTHRUG, 54
NEAR 104
THE 25
FENDER, 30
(WITH 86
ALICE'S 172
LOVE). 9
Oh 153
dear, 186
what 196
nonsense 105
I'm 71
talking!' 92
Just 52
then 141
her 189
head 32
struck 108
against 23
the 1
roof 188
of 143
the 1
hall: 105
in 165
fact 84
she 40
was 81
now 70
more 125
than 17
nine 26
feet 190
high, 90
and 127
she 40
at 123
once 81
took 175
up 139
the 1
little 2
golden 143
key 79
and 127
hurried 83
off 135
to 107
the 1
garden 91
door. 152
Poor 106
Alice! 41
It 179
was 81
as 122
much 29
as 122
she 40
could 65
do, 185
lying 197
down 170
on 151
one 182
side, 45
to 107
look 47
through 171
into 72
the 1
garden 91
with 134
one 182
eye; 162
but 121
to 107
get 30
through 171
was 81
more 125
hopeless 3
than 17
ever: 12
she 40
sat 38
down 170
and 127
began 49
to 107
cry 194
again. 98
`You 23
ought 101
to 107
be 139
ashamed 103
of 143
yourself,' 150
said 137
Alice, 52
`a 73
great 21
girl 20
like 151
you,' 82
(she 80
might 167
well 46
say 43
this), 111
`to 163
go 104
on 151
crying 24
in 165
this 70
way! 130
Stop 82
this 70
moment, 12
I 73
tell 73
you!' 141
But 169
she 40
went 116
on 151
all 73
the 1
same, 166
shedding 6
gallons 30
of 143
tears, 69
until 6
there 196
was 81
a 97
large 43
pool 12
all 73
round 142
her, 103
about 69
four 94
inches 32
deep 4
and 127
reaching 49
half 131
down 170
the 1
hall. 93
After 68
a 97
time 141
she 40
heard 126
a 97
little 2
pattering 68
of 143
feet 190
in 165
the 1
distance, 167
and 127
she 40
hastily 4
dried 10
her 189
eyes 18
to 107
see 147
what 196
was 81
coming. 157
It 179
was 81
the 1
White 193
Rabbit 110
returning, 26
splendidly 116
dressed, 170
with 134
a 97
pair 178
of 143
white 65
kid 182
gloves 30
in 165
one 182
hand 191
and 127
a 97
large 43
fan 139
in 165
the 1
other: 182
he 125
came 6
trotting 49
along 149
in 165
a 97
great 21
hurry, 112
muttering 157
to 107
himself 32
as 122
he 125
came, 30
`Oh! 112
the 1
Duchess, 13
the 1
Duchess! 2
Oh! 176
won't 35
she 40
be 139
savage 145
if 157
I've 181
kept 86
her 189
waiting!' 173
Alice 168
felt 7
so 76
desperate 63
that 23
she 40
was 81
ready 123
to 107
ask 89
help 185
of 143
any 148
one; 101
so, 0
when 114
the 1
Rabbit 110
came 6
near 192
her, 103
she 40
began, 133
in 165
a 97
low, 32
timid 195
voice, 78
`If 21
you 39
please, 86
sir--' 173
The 49
Rabbit 110
started 151
violently, 100
dropped 184
the 1
white 65
kid 182
gloves 30
and 127
the 1
fan, 153
and 127
skurried 157
away 14
into 72
the 1
darkness 13
as 122
hard 115
as 122
he 125
could 65
go. 70
Alice 168
took 175
up 139
the 1
fan 139
and 127
gloves, 178
and, 181
as 122
the 1
hall 137
was 81
very 54
hot, 175
she 40
kept 86
fanning 65
herself 33
all 73
the 1
time 141
she 40
went 116
on 151
talking: 140
`Dear, 86
dear! 175
How 152
queer 126
everything 163
is 170
to-day! 97
And 175
yesterday 174
things 123
went 116
on 151
just 164
as 122
usual. 156
I 73
wonder 141
if 157
I've 181
been 20
changed 68
in 165
the 1
night? 105
Let 83
me 80
think: 56
was 81
I 73
the 1
same 62
when 114
I 73
got 140
up 139
this 70
morning? 77
I 73
almost 10
think 122
I 73
can 56
remember 35
feeling 132
a 97
little 2
different. 61
But 169
if 157
I'm 71
not 67
the 1
same, 166
the 1
next 107
question 106
is, 114
Who 142
in 165
the 1
world 2
am 116
I? 126
Ah, 133
THAT'S 69
the 1
great 21
puzzle!' 12
And 175
she 40
began 49
thinking 80
over 44
all 73
the 1
children 55
she 40
knew 197
that 23
were 25
of 143
the 1
same 62
age 111
as 122
herself, 109
to 107
see 147
if 157
she 40
could 65
have 40
been 20
changed 68
for 177
any 148
of 143
them. 186
`I'm 7
sure 37
I'm 71
not 67
Ada,' 185
she 40
said, 91
`for 113
her 189
hair 50
goes 190
in 165
such 175
long 12
ringlets, 172
and 127
mine 35
doesn't 66
go 104
in 165
ringlets 56
at 123
all; 122
and 127
I'm 71
sure 37
I 73
can't 141
be 139
Mabel, 161
for 177
I 73
know 107
all 73
sorts 181
of 143
things, 193
and 127
she, 84
oh! 128
she 40
knows 32
such 175
a 97
very 54
little! 139
Besides, 123
SHE'S 196
she, 84
and 127
I'm 71
I, 107
and--oh 64
dear, 186
how 104
puzzling 107
it 171
all 73
is! 103
I'll 78
try 131
if 157
I 73
know 107
all 73
the 1
things 123
I 73
used 93
to 107
know. 163
Let 83
me 80
see: 15
four 94
times 86
five 146
is 170
twelve, 13
and 127
four 94
times 86
six 90
is 170
thirteen, 43
and 127
four 94
times 86
seven 45
is--oh 141
dear! 175
I 73
shall 52
never 44
get 30
to 107
twenty 63
at 123
that 23
rate! 161
However, 10
the 1
Multiplication 26
Table 118
doesn't 66
signify: 155
let's 159
try 131
Geography. 178
London 128
is 170
the 1
capital 48
of 143
Paris, 191
and 127
Paris 131
is 170
the 1
capital 48
of 143
Rome, 47
and 127
Rome--no, 130
THAT'S 69
all 73
wrong, 185
I'm 71
certain! 81
I 73
must 137
have 40
been 20
changed 68
for 177
Mabel! 172
I'll 78
try 131
and 127
say 43
"How 46
doth 71
the 1
little--"' 45
and 127
she 40
crossed 159
her 189
hands 36
on 151
her 189
lap 107
as 122
if 157
she 40
were 25
saying 65
lessons, 121
and 127
began 49
to 107
repeat 85
it, 145
but 121
her 189
voice 154
sounded 26
hoarse 14
and 127
strange, 24
and 127
the 1
words 169
did 55
not 67
come 60
the 1
same 62
as 122
they 152
used 93
to 107
do:-- 79
`How 88
doth 71
the 1
little 2
crocodile 90
Improve 8
his 114
shining 48
tail, 60
And 175
pour 4
the 1
waters 124
of 143
the 1
Nile 52
On 159
every 75
golden 143
scale! 73
`How 88
cheerfully 85
he 125
seems 161
to 107
grin, 196
How 152
neatly 193
spread 37
his 114
claws, 184
And 175
welcome 18
little 2
fishes 34
in 165
With 22
gently 167
smiling 75
jaws!' 47
`I'm 7
sure 37
those 37
are 52
not 67
the 1
right 172
words,' 12
said 137
poor 18
Alice, 52
and 127
her 189
eyes 18
filled 142
with 134
tears 193
again 192
as 122
she 40
went 116
on, 125
`I 49
must 137
be 139
Mabel 61
after 140
all, 107
and 127
I 73
shall 52
have 40
to 107
go 104
and 127
live 92
in 165
that 23
poky 101
little 2
house, 124
and 127
have 40
next 107
to 107
no 121
toys 93
to 107
play 108
with, 198
and 127
oh! 128
ever 134
so 76
many 167
lessons 67
to 107
learn! 43
No, 43
I've 181
made 37
up 139
my 100
mind 34
about 69
it; 160
if 157
I'm 71
Mabel, 161
I'll 78
stay 169
down 170
here! 193
It'll 124
be 139
no 121
use 103
their 130
putting 155
their 130
heads 107
down 170
and 127
saying 65
"Come 62
up 139
again, 100
dear!" 37
I 73
shall 52
only 180
look 47
up 139
and 127
say 43
"Who 36
am 116
I 73
then? 34
Tell 161
me 80
that 23
first, 60
and 127
then, 15
if 157
I 73
like 151
being 167
that 23
person, 97
I'll 78
come 60
up: 167
if 157
not, 121
I'll 78
stay 169
down 170
here 160
till 117
I'm 71
somebody 86
else"--but, 108
oh 145
dear!' 32
cried 89
Alice, 52
with 134
a 97
sudden 133
burst 40
of 143
tears, 69
`I 49
do 11
wish 103
they 152
WOULD 125
put 175
their 130
heads 107
down! 103
I 73
am 116
so 76
VERY 166
tired 76
of 143
being 167
all 73
alone 147
here!' 74
As 130
she 40
said 137
this 70
she 40
looked 98
down 170
at 123
her 189
hands, 136
and 127
was 81
surprised 83
to 107
see 147
that 23
she 40
had 51
put 175
on 151
one 182
of 143
the 1
Rabbit's 146
little 2
white 65
kid 182
gloves 30
while 17
she 40
was 81
talking. 152
`How 88
CAN 80
I 73
have 40
done 82
that?' 1
she 40
thought. 37
`I 49
must 137
be 139
growing 23
small 7
again.' 39
She 88
got 140
up 139
and 127
went 116
to 107
the 1
table 190
to 107
measure 46
herself 33
by 159
it, 145
and 127
found 90
that, 157
as 122
nearly 115
as 122
she 40
could 65
guess, 171
she 40
was 81
now 70
about 69
two 76
feet 190
high, 90
and 127
was 81
going 82
on 151
shrinking 121
rapidly: 129
she 40
soon 187
found 90
out 14
that 23
the 1
cause 9
of 143
this 70
was 81
the 1
fan 139
she 40
was 81
holding, 95
and 127
she 40
dropped 184
it 171
hastily, 88
just 164
in 165
time 141
to 107
avoid 101
shrinking 121
away 14
altogether. 159
`That 127
WAS 105
a 97
narrow 61
escape!' 111
said 137
Alice, 52
a 97
good 85
deal 76
frightened 154
at 123
the 1
sudden 133
change, 12
but 121
very 54
glad 168
to 107
find 97
herself 33
still 32
in 165
existence; 49
`and 63
now 70
for 177
the 1
garden!' 109
and 127
she 40
ran 71
with 134
all 73
speed 199
back 111
to 107
the 1
little 2
door: 164
but, 195
alas! 180
the 1
little 2
door 126
was 81
shut 52
again, 100
and 127
the 1
little 2
golden 143
key 79
was 81
lying 197
on 151
the 1
glass 188
table 190
as 122
before, 155
`and 63
things 123
are 52
worse 20
than 17
ever,' 119
thought 199
the 1
poor 18
child, 176
`for 113
I 73
never 44
was 81
so 76
small 7
as 122
this 70
before, 155
never! 99
And 175
I 73
declare 194
it's 55
too 28
bad, 79
that 23
it 171
is!' 32
As 130
she 40
said 137
these 27
words 169
her 189
foot 110
slipped, 43
and 127
in 165
another 173
moment, 12
splash! 6
she 40
was 81
up 139
to 107
her 189
chin 18
in 165
salt 46
water. 193
Her 37
first 32
idea 183
was 81
that 23
she 40
had 51
somehow 140
fallen 100
into 72
the 1
sea, 77
`and 63
in 165
that 23
case 192
I 73
can 56
go 104
back 111
by 159
railway,' 8
she 40
said 137
to 107
herself. 107
(Alice 8
had 51
been 20
to 107
the 1
seaside 70
once 81
in 165
her 189
life, 120
and 127
had 51
come 60
to 107
the 1
general 48
conclusion, 67
that 23
wherever 148
you 39
go 104
to 107
on 151
the 1
English 24
coast 78
you 39
find 97
a 97
number 87
of 143
bathing 113
machines 124
in 165
the 1
sea, 77
some 116
children 55
digging 93
in 165
the 1
sand 92
with 134
wooden 154
spades, 66
then 141
a 97
row 114
of 143
lodging 92
houses, 65
and 127
behind 198
them 140
a 97
railway 197
station.) 49
However, 10
she 40
soon 187
made 37
out 14
that 23
she 40
was 81
in 165
the 1
pool 12
of 143
tears 193
which 141
she 40
had 51
wept 178
when 114
she 40
was 81
nine 26
feet 190
high. 92
`I 49
wish 103
I 73
hadn't 120
cried 89
so 76
much!' 165
said 137
Alice, 52
as 122
she 40
swam 40
about, 113
trying 57
to 107
find 97
her 189
way 87
out. 80
`I 49
shall 52
be 139
punished 132
for 177
it 171
now, 14
I 73
suppose, 155
by 159
being 167
drowned 199
in 165
my 100
own 70
tears! 80
That 111
WILL 2
be 139
a 97
queer 126
thing, 194
to 107
be 139
sure! 180
However, 10
everything 163
is 170
queer 126
to-day.' 99
Just 52
then 141
she 40
heard 126
something 182
splashing 147
about 69
in 165
the 1
pool 12
a 97
little 2
way 87
off, 29
and 127
she 40
swam 40
nearer 139
to 107
make 54
out 14
what 196
it 171
was: 169
at 123
first 32
she 40
thought 199
it 171
must 137
be 139
a 97
walrus 66
or 155
hippopotamus, 197
but 121
then 141
she 40
remembered 28
how 104
small 7
she 40
was 81
now, 14
and 127
she 40
soon 187
made 37
out 14
that 23
it 171
was 81
only 180
a 97
mouse 93
that 23
had 51
slipped 17
in 165
like 151
herself. 107
`Would 187
it 171
be 139
of 143
any 148
use, 37
now,' 73
thought 199
Alice, 52
`to 163
speak 82
to 107
this 70
mouse? 150
Everything 69
is 170
so 76
out-of-the-way 12
down 170
here, 4
that 23
I 73
should 61
think 122
very 54
likely 116
it 171
can 56
talk: 126
at 123
any 148
rate, 172
there's 120
no 121
harm 124
in 165
trying.' 112
So 84
she 40
began: 119
`O 55
Mouse, 1
do 11
you 39
know 107
the 1
way 87
out 14
of 143
this 70
pool? 35
I 73
am 116
very 54
tired 76
of 143
swimming 67
about 69
here, 4
O 79
Mouse!' 189
(Alice 8
thought 199
this 70
must 137
be 139
the 1
right 172
way 87
of 143
speaking 176
to 107
a 97
mouse: 155
she 40
had 51
never 44
done 82
such 175
a 97
thing 118
before, 155
but 121
she 40
remembered 28
having 99
seen 67
in 165
her 189
brother's 108
Latin 164
Grammar, 181
`A 41
mouse--of 60
a 97
mouse--to 24
a 97
mouse--a 12
mouse--O 30
mouse!') 186
The 49
Mouse 21
looked 98
at 123
her 189
rather 0
inquisitively, 147
and 127
seemed 39
to 107
her 189
to 107
wink 151
with 134
one 182
of 143
its 16
little 2
eyes, 2
but 121
it 171
said 137
nothing. 17
`Perhaps 177
it 171
doesn't 66
understand 178
English,' 77
thought 199
Alice; 67
`I 49
daresay 59
it's 55
a 97
French 138
mouse, 169
come 60
over 44
with 134
William 5
the 1
Conqueror.' 23
(For, 59
with 134
all 73
her 189
knowledge 14
of 143
history, 144
Alice 168
had 51
no 121
very 54
clear 189
notion 43
how 104
long 12
ago 121
anything 54
had 51
happened.) 124
So 84
she 40
began 49
again: 86
`Ou 22
est 142
ma 76
chatte?' 129
which 141
was 81
the 1
first 32
sentence 195
in 165
her 189
French 138
lesson-book. 56
The 49
Mouse 21
gave 49
a 97
sudden 133
leap 8
out 14
of 143
the 1
water, 195
and 127
seemed 39
to 107
quiver 178
all 73
over 44
with 134
fright. 72
`Oh, 123
I 73
beg 12
your 123
pardon!' 128
cried 89
Alice 168
hastily, 88
afraid 161
that 23
she 40
had 51
hurt 151
the 1
poor 18
animal's 160
feelings. 113
`I 49
quite 22
forgot 149
you 39
didn't 156
like 151
cats.' 74
`Not 51
like 151
cats!' 77
cried 89
the 1
Mouse, 1
in 165
a 97
shrill, 144
passionate 179
voice. 76
`Would 187
YOU 63
like 151
cats 37
if 157
you 39
were 25
me?' 72
`Well, 2
perhaps 119
not,' 190
said 137
Alice 168
in 165
a 97
soothing 75
tone: 136
`don't 64
be 139
angry 185
about 69
it. 147
And 175
yet 128
I 73
wish 103
I 73
could 65
show 69
you 39
our 12
cat 62
Dinah: 82
I 73
think 122
you'd 188
take 191
a 97
fancy 169
to 107
cats 37
if 157
you 39
could 65
only 180
see 147
her. 105
She 88
is 170
such 175
a 97
dear 82
quiet 172
thing,' 199
Alice 168
went 116
on, 125
half 131
to 107
herself, 109
as 122
she 40
swam 40
lazily 175
about 69
in 165
the 1
pool, 16
`and 63
she 40
sits 181
purring 179
so 76
nicely 142
by 159
the 1
fire, 126
licking 29
her 189
paws 13
and 127
washing 83
her 189
face--and 22
she 40
is 170
such 175
a 97
nice 85
soft 114
thing 118
to 107
nurse--and 66
she's 164
such 175
a 97
capital 48
one 182
for 177
catching 143
mice--oh, 171
I 73
beg 12
your 123
pardon!' 128
cried 89
Alice 168
again, 100
for 177
this 70
time 141
the 1
Mouse 21
was 81
bristling 120
all 73
over, 8
and 127
she 40
felt 7
certain 186
it 171
must 137
be 139
really 77
offended. 171
`We 54
won't 35
talk 28
about 69
her 189
any 148
more 125
if 157
you'd 188
rather 0
not.' 52
`We 54
indeed!' 123
cried 89
the 1
Mouse, 1
who 94
was 81
trembling 2
down 170
to 107
the 1
end 171
of 143
his 114
tail. 62
`As 186
if 157
I 73
would 85
talk 28
on 151
such 175
a 97
subject! 27
Our 60
family 164
always 169
HATED 58
cats: 5
nasty, 113
low, 32
vulgar 189
things! 4
Don't 64
let 35
me 80
hear 46
the 1
name 107
again!' 42
`I 49
won't 35
indeed!' 123
said 137
Alice, 52
in 165
a 97
great 21
hurry 140
to 107
change 32
the 1
subject 68
of 143
conversation. 35
`Are 36
you--are 123
you 39
fond--of--of 3
dogs?' 185
The 49
Mouse 21
did 55
not 67
answer, 66
so 76
Alice 168
went 116
on 151
eagerly: 115
`There 76
is 170
such 175
a 97
nice 85
little 2
dog 44
near 192
our 12
house 88
I 73
should 61
like 151
to 107
show 69
you! 42
A 65
little 2
bright-eyed 178
terrier, 81
you 39
know, 161
with 134
oh, 139
such 175
long 12
curly 149
brown 102
hair! 183
And 175
it'll 196
fetch 82
things 123
when 114
you 39
throw 14
them, 184
and 127
it'll 196
sit 86
up 139
and 127
beg 12
for 177
its 16
dinner, 98
and 127
all 73
sorts 181
of 143
things--I 148
can't 141
remember 35
half 131
of 143
them--and 101
it 171
belongs 140
to 107
a 97
farmer, 151
you 39
know, 161
and 127
he 125
says 48
it's 55
so 76
useful, 26
it's 55
worth 54
a 97
hundred 174
pounds! 6
He 133
says 48
it 171
kills 53
all 73
the 1
rats 102
and--oh 64
dear!' 32
cried 89
Alice 168
in 165
a 97
sorrowful 111
tone, 122
`I'm 7
afraid 161
I've 181
offended 21
it 171
again!' 42
For 25
the 1
Mouse 21
was 81
swimming 67
away 14
from 186
her 189
as 122
hard 115
as 122
it 171
could 65
go, 68
and 127
making 45
quite 22
a 97
commotion 113
in 165
the 1
pool 12
as 122
it 171
went. 42
So 84
she 40
called 163
softly 73
after 140
it, 145
`Mouse 179
dear! 175
Do 19
come 60
back 111
again, 100
and 127
we 190
won't 35
talk 28
about 69
cats 37
or 155
dogs 79
either, 137
if 157
you 39
don't 136
like 151
them!' 94
When 2
the 1
Mouse 21
heard 126
this, 14
it 171
turned 108
round 142
and 127
swam 40
slowly 34
back 111
to 107
her: 117
its 16
face 69
was 81
quite 22
pale 58
(with 174
passion, 101
Alice 168
thought), 76
and 127
it 171
said 137
in 165
a 97
low 148
trembling 2
voice, 78
`Let 19
us 142
get 30
to 107
the 1
shore, 17
and 127
then 141
I'll 78
tell 73
you 39
my 100
history, 144
and 127
you'll 112
understand 178
why 104
it 171
is 170
I 73
hate 178
cats 37
and 127
dogs.' 112
It 179
was 81
high 66
time 141
to 107
go, 68
for 177
the 1
pool 12
was 81
getting 108
quite 22
crowded 108
with 134
the 1
birds 82
and 127
animals 145
that 23
had 51
fallen 100
into 72
it: 159
there 196
were 25
a 97
Duck 1
and 127
a 97
Dodo, 14
a 97
Lory 42
and 127
an 117
Eaglet, 12
and 127
several 100
other 176
curious 132
creatures. 170
Alice 168
led 19
the 1
way, 141
and 127
the 1
whole 183
party 150
swam 40
to 107
the 1
shore. 15
CHAPTER 45
III 89
A 65
Caucus-Race 124
and 127
a 97
Long 100
Tale 110
They 40
were 25
indeed 139
a 97
queer-looking 124
party 150
that 23
assembled 26
on 151
the 1
bank--the 83
birds 82
with 134
draggled 104
feathers, 4
the 1
animals 145
with 134
their 130
fur 163
clinging 121
close 144
to 107
them, 184
and 127
all 73
dripping 89
wet, 30
cross, 28
and 127
uncomfortable. 151
The 49
first 32
question 106
of 143
course 149
was, 155
how 104
to 107
get 30
dry 155
again: 86
they 152
had 51
a 97
consultation 159
about 69
this, 14
and 127
after 140
a 97
few 72
minutes 55
it 171
seemed 39
quite 22
natural 1
to 107
Alice 168
to 107
find 97
herself 33
talking 34
familiarly 146
with 134
them, 184
as 122
if 157
she 40
had 51
known 27
them 140
all 73
her 189
life. 122
Indeed, 17
she 40
had 51
quite 22
a 97
long 12
argument 99
with 134
the 1
Lory, 146
who 94
at 123
last 126
turned 108
sulky, 124
and 127
would 85
only 180
say, 177
`I 49
am 116
older 4
than 17
you, 53
and 127
must 137
know 107
better'; 20
and 127
this 70
Alice 168
would 85
not 67
allow 113
without 8
knowing 153
how 104
old 119
it 171
was, 155
and, 181
as 122
the 1
Lory 42
positively 134
refused 16
to 107
tell 73
its 16
age, 85
there 196
was 81
no 121
more 125
to 107
be 139
said. 93
At 131
last 126
the 1
Mouse, 1
who 94
seemed 39
to 107
be 139
a 97
person 123
of 143
authority 35
among 140
them, 184
called 163
out, 78
`Sit 70
down, 114
all 73
of 143
you, 53
and 127
listen 1
to 107
me! 113
I'LL 54
soon 187
make 54
you 39
dry 155
enough!' 198
They 40
all 73
sat 38
down 170
at 123
once, 155
in 165
a 97
large 43
ring, 196
with 134
the 1
Mouse 21
in 165
the 1
middle. 41
Alice 168
kept 86
her 189
eyes 18
anxiously 92
fixed 148
on 151
it, 145
for 177
she 40
felt 7
sure 37
she 40
would 85
catch 155
a 97
bad 85
cold 28
if 157
she 40
did 55
not 67
get 30
dry 155
very 54
soon. 43
`Ahem!' 157
said 137
the 1
Mouse 21
with 134
an 117
important 78
air, 10
`are 188
you 39
all 73
ready? 20
This 158
is 170
the 1
driest 5
thing 118
I 73
know. 163
Silence 111
all 73
round, 50
if 157
you 39
please! 97
"William 137
the 1
Conqueror, 62
whose 0
cause 9
was 81
favoured 56
by 159
the 1
pope, 160
was 81
soon 187
submitted 195
to 107
by 159
the 1
English, 188
who 94
wanted 73
leaders, 122
and 127
had 51
been 20
of 143
late 142
much 29
accustomed 178
to 107
usurpation 32
and 127
conquest. 66
Edwin 173
and 127
Morcar, 136
the 1
earls 165
of 143
Mercia 183
and 127
Northumbria--"' 50
`Ugh!' 36
said 137
the 1
Lory, 146
with 134
a 97
shiver. 199
`I 49
beg 12
your 123
pardon!' 128
said 137
the 1
Mouse, 1
frowning, 44
but 121
very 54
politely: 160
`Did 39
you 39
speak?' 6
`Not 51
I!' 15
said 137
the 1
Lory 42
hastily. 90
`I 49
thought 199
you 39
did,' 58
said 137
the 1
Mouse. 199
`--I 49
proceed. 128
"Edwin 107
and 127
Morcar, 136
the 1
earls 165
of 143
Mercia 183
and 127
Northumbria, 105
declared 58
for 177
him: 6
and 127
even 130
Stigand, 132
the 1
patriotic 47
archbishop 173
of 143
Canterbury, 199
found 90
it 171
advisable--"' 100
`Found 182
WHAT?' 116
said 137
the 1
Duck. 77
`Found 182
IT,' 70
the 1
Mouse 21
replied 97
rather 0
crossly: 93
`of 199
course 149
you 39
know 107
what 196
"it" 29
means.' 199
`I 49
know 107
what 196
"it" 29
means 22
well 46
enough, 92
when 114
I 73
find 97
a 97
thing,' 199
said 137
the 1
Duck: 89
`it's 71
generally 69
a 97
frog 180
or 155
a 97
worm. 179
The 49
question 106
is, 114
what 196
did 55
the 1
archbishop 173
find?' 87
The 49
Mouse 21
did 55
not 67
notice 24
this 70
question, 74
but 121
hurriedly 168
went 116
on, 125
`"--found 104
it 171
advisable 129
to 107
go 104
with 134
Edgar 153
Atheling 46
to 107
meet 127
William 5
and 127
offer 180
him 108
the 1
crown. 137
William's 71
conduct 196
at 123
first 32
was 81
moderate. 173
But 169
the 1
insolence 50
of 143
his 114
Normans--" 8
How 152
are 52
you 39
getting 108
on 151
now, 14
my 100
dear?' 102
it 171
continued, 47
turning 115
to 107
Alice 168
as 122
it 171
spoke. 174
`As 186
wet 6
as 122
ever,' 119
said 137
Alice 168
in 165
a 97
melancholy 190
tone: 136
`it 27
doesn't 66
seem 66
to 107
dry 155
me 80
at 123
all.' 18
`In 29
that 23
case,' 181
said 137
the 1
Dodo 70
solemnly, 199
rising 194
to 107
its 16
feet, 134
`I 49
move 49
that 23
the 1
meeting 67
adjourn, 69
for 177
the 1
immediate 41
adoption 136
of 143
more 125
energetic 38
remedies--' 113
`Speak 190
English!' 18
said 137
the 1
Eaglet. 10
`I 49
don't 136
know 107
the 1
meaning 37
of 143
half 131
those 37
long 12
words, 13
and, 181
what's 16
more, 119
I 73
don't 136
believe 84
you 39
do 11
either!' 99
And 175
the 1
Eaglet 64
bent 105
down 170
its 16
head 32
to 107
hide 170
a 97
smile: 110
some 116
of 143
the 1
other 176
birds 82
tittered 127
audibly. 136
`What 100
I 73
was 81
going 82
to 107
say,' 126
said 137
the 1
Dodo 70
in 165
an 117
offended 21
tone, 122
`was, 171
that 23
the 1
best 60
thing 118
to 107
get 30
us 142
dry 155
would 85
be 139
a 97
Caucus-race.' 69
`What 100
IS 146
a 97
Caucus-race?' 196
said 137
Alice; 67
not 67
that 23
she 40
wanted 73
much 29
to 107
know, 161
but 121
the 1
Dodo 70
had 51
paused 154
as 122
if 157
it 171
thought 199
that 23
SOMEBODY 194
ought 101
to 107
speak, 110
and 127
no 121
one 182
else 145
seemed 39
inclined 162
to 107
say 43
anything. 36
`Why,' 125
said 137
the 1
Dodo, 14
`the 137
best 60
way 87
to 107
explain 49
it 171
is 170
to 107
do 11
it.' 196
(And, 109
as 122
you 39
might 167
like 151
to 107
try 131
the 1
thing 118
yourself, 29
some 116
winter 91
day, 112
I 73
will 90
tell 73
you 39
how 104
the 1
Dodo 70
managed 119
it.) 198
First 160
it 171
marked 68
out 14
a 97
race-course, 181
in 165
a 97
sort 86
of 143
circle, 124
(`the 177
exact 143
shape 169
doesn't 66
matter,' 132
it 171
said,) 34
and 127
then 141
all 73
the 1
party 150
were 25
placed 19
along 149
the 1
course, 185
here 160
and 127
there. 174
There 124
was 81
no 121
`One, 190
two, 0
three, 186
and 127
away,' 39
but 121
they 152
began 49
running 135
when 114
they 152
liked, 41
and 127
left 167
off 135
when 114
they 152
liked, 41
so 76
that 23
it 171
was 81
not 67
easy 194
to 107
know 107
when 114
the 1
race 161
was 81
over. 10
However, 10
when 114
they 152
had 51
been 20
running 135
half 131
an 117
hour 76
or 155
so, 0
and 127
were 25
quite 22
dry 155
again, 100
the 1
Dodo 70
suddenly 40
called 163
out 14
`The 185
race 161
is 170
over!' 150
and 127
they 152
all 73
crowded 108
round 142
it, 145
panting, 89
and 127
asking, 45
`But 105
who 94
has 66
won?' 102
This 158
question 106
the 1
Dodo 70
could 65
not 67
answer 170
without 8
a 97
great 21
deal 76
of 143
thought, 35
and 127
it 171
sat 38
for 177
a 97
long 12
time 141
with 134
one 182
finger 151
pressed 86
upon 130
its 16
forehead 188
(the 41
position 169
in 165
which 141
you 39
usually 17
see 147
Shakespeare, 154
in 165
the 1
pictures 171
of 143
him), 103
while 17
the 1
rest 116
waited 28
in 165
silence. 61
At 131
last 126
the 1
Dodo 70
said, 91
`EVERYBODY 109
has 66
won, 54
and 127
all 73
must 137
have 40
prizes.' 78
`But 105
who 94
is 170
to 107
give 137
the 1
prizes?' 151
quite 22
a 97
chorus 66
of 143
voices 7
asked. 90
`Why, 172
SHE, 28
of 143
course,' 98
said 137
the 1
Dodo, 14
pointing 26
to 107
Alice 168
with 134
one 182
finger; 158
and 127
the 1
whole 183
party 150
at 123
once 81
crowded 108
round 142
her, 103
calling 164
out 14
in 165
a 97
confused 143
way, 141
`Prizes! 144
Prizes!' 153
Alice 168
had 51
no 121
idea 183
what 196
to 107
do, 185
and 127
in 165
despair 28
she 40
put 175
her 189
hand 191
in 165
her 189
pocket, 154
and 127
pulled 180
out 14
a 97
box 139
of 143
comfits, 47
(luckily 61
the 1
salt 46
water 47
had 51
not 67
got 140
into 72
it), 46
and 127
handed 114
them 140
round 142
as 122
prizes. 139
There 124
was 81
exactly 20
one 182
a-piece 170
all 73
round. 48
`But 105
she 40
must 137
have 40
a 97
prize 114
herself, 109
you 39
know,' 66
said 137
the 1
Mouse. 199
`Of 7
course,' 98
the 1
Dodo 70
replied 97
very 54
gravely. 4
`What 100
else 145
have 40
you 39
got 140
in 165
your 123
pocket?' 142
he 125
went 116
on, 125
turning 115
to 107
Alice. 54
`Only 84
a 97
thimble,' 90
said 137
Alice 168
sadly. 109
`Hand 95
it 171
over 44
here,' 133
said 137
the 1
Dodo. 16
Then 29
they 152
all 73
crowded 108
round 142
her 189
once 81
more, 119
while 17
the 1
Dodo 70
solemnly 123
presented 198
the 1
thimble, 185
saying 65
`We 54
beg 12
your 123
acceptance 57
of 143
this 70
elegant 186
thimble'; 25
and, 181
when 114
it 171
had 51
finished 14
this 70
short 100
speech, 54
they 152
all 73
cheered. 90
Alice 168
thought 199
the 1
whole 183
thing 118
very 54
absurd, 1
but 121
they 152
all 73
looked 98
so 76
grave 13
that 23
she 40
did 55
not 67
dare 152
to 107
laugh; 38
and, 181
as 122
she 40
could 65
not 67
think 122
of 143
anything 54
to 107
say, 177
she 40
simply 106
bowed, 133
and 127
took 175
the 1
thimble, 185
looking 187
as 122
solemn 122
as 122
she 40
could. 35
The 49
next 107
thing 118
was 81
to 107
eat 184
the 1
comfits: 33
this 70
caused 117
some 116
noise 82
and 127
confusion, 46
as 122
the 1
large 43
birds 82
complained 192
that 23
they 152
could 65
not 67
taste 175
theirs, 61
and 127
the 1
small 7
ones 157
choked 104
and 127
had 51
to 107
be 139
patted 184
on 151
the 1
back. 87
However, 10
it 171
was 81
over 44
at 123
last, 150
and 127
they 152
sat 38
down 170
again 192
in 165
a 97
ring, 196
and 127
begged 190
the 1
Mouse 21
to 107
tell 73
them 140
something 182
more. 121
`You 23
promised 15
to 107
tell 73
me 80
your 123
history, 144
you 39
know,' 66
said 137
Alice, 52
`and 63
why 104
it 171
is 170
you 39
hate--C 193
and 127
D,' 151
she 40
added 168
in 165
a 97
whisper, 126
half 131
afraid 161
that 23
it 171
would 85
be 139
offended 21
again. 98
`Mine 139
is 170
a 97
long 12
and 127
a 97
sad 22
tale!' 92
said 137
the 1
Mouse, 1
turning 115
to 107
Alice, 52
and 127
sighing. 147
`It 35
IS 146
a 97
long 12
tail, 60
certainly,' 38
said 137
Alice, 52
looking 187
down 170
with 134
wonder 141
at 123
the 1
Mouse's 127
tail; 75
`but 57
why 104
do 11
you 39
call 182
it 171
sad?' 134
And 175
she 40
kept 86
on 151
puzzling 107
about 69
it 171
while 17
the 1
Mouse 21
was 81
speaking, 172
so 76
that 23
her 189
idea 183
of 143
the 1
tale 22
was 81
something 182
like 151
this:-- 52
`Fury 78
said 137
to 107
a 97
mouse, 169
That 111
he 125
met 196
in 165
the 1
house, 124
"Let 177
us 142
both 89
go 104
to 107
law: 192
I 73
will 90
prosecute 54
YOU. 199
--Come, 88
I'll 78
take 191
no 121
denial; 124
We 198
must 137
have 40
a 97
trial: 108
For 25
really 77
this 70
morning 4
I've 181
nothing 181
to 107
do." 31
Said 25
the 1
mouse 93
to 107
the 1
cur, 124
"Such 177
a 97
trial, 122
dear 82
Sir, 136
With 22
no 121
jury 138
or 155
judge, 75
would 85
be 139
wasting 175
our 12
breath." 68
"I'll 192
be 139
judge, 75
I'll 78
be 139
jury," 80
Said 25
cunning 8
old 119
Fury: 180
"I'll 192
try 131
the 1
whole 183
cause, 173
and 127
condemn 124
you 39
to 107
death."' 175
`You 23
are 52
not 67
attending!' 26
said 137
the 1
Mouse 21
to 107
Alice 168
severely. 59
`What 100
are 52
you 39
thinking 80
of?' 15
`I 49
beg 12
your 123
pardon,' 69
said 137
Alice 168
very 54
humbly: 83
`you 175
had 51
got 140
to 107
the 1
fifth 119
bend, 3
I 73
think?' 166
`I 49
had 51
NOT!' 113
cried 89
the 1
Mouse, 1
sharply 127
and 127
very 54
angrily. 56
`A 41
knot!' 90
said 137
Alice, 52
always 169
ready 123
to 107
make 54
herself 33
useful, 26
and 127
looking 187
anxiously 92
about 69
her. 105
`Oh, 123
do 11
let 35
me 80
help 185
to 107
undo 68
it!' 193
`I 49
shall 52
do 11
nothing 181
of 143
the 1
sort,' 47
said 137
the 1
Mouse, 1
getting 108
up 139
and 127
walking 9
away. 80
`You 23
insult 65
me 80
by 159
talking 34
such 175
nonsense!' 39
`I 49
didn't 156
mean 197
it!' 193
pleaded 45
poor 18
Alice. 54
`But 105
you're 133
so 76
easily 169
offended, 169
you 39
know!' 7
The 49
Mouse 21
only 180
growled 24
in 165
reply. 84
`Please 178
come 60
back 111
and 127
finish 5
your 123
story!' 21
Alice 168
called 163
after 140
it; 160
and 127
the 1
others 125
all 73
joined 63
in 165
chorus, 158
`Yes, 85
please 142
do!' 33
but 121
the 1
Mouse 21
only 180
shook 198
its 16
head 32
impatiently, 182
and 127
walked 104
a 97
little 2
quicker. 172
`What 100
a 97
pity 14
it 171
wouldn't 14
stay!' 25
sighed 178
the 1
Lory, 146
as 122
soon 187
as 122
it 171
was 81
quite 22
out 14
of 143
sight; 154
and 127
an 117
old 119
Crab 56
took 175
the 1
opportunity 157
of 143
saying 65
to 107
her 189
daughter 16
`Ah, 69
my 100
dear! 175
Let 83
this 70
be 139
a 97
lesson 136
to 107
you 39
never 44
to 107
lose 165
YOUR 35
temper!' 65
`Hold 87
your 123
tongue, 48
Ma!' 186
said 137
the 1
young 192
Crab, 180
a 97
little 2
snappishly. 65
`You're 187
enough 0
to 107
try 131
the 1
patience 33
of 143
an 117
oyster!' 122
`I 49
wish 103
I 73
had 51
our 12
Dinah 104
here, 4
I 73
know 107
I 73
do!' 33
said 137
Alice 168
aloud, 199
addressing 70
nobody 45
in 165
particular. 1
`She'd 123
soon 187
fetch 82
it 171
back!' 163
`And 111
who 94
is 170
Dinah, 68
if 157
I 73
might 167
venture 147
to 107
ask 89
the 1
question?' 182
said 137
the 1
Lory. 148
Alice 168
replied 97
eagerly, 129
for 177
she 40
was 81
always 169
ready 123
to 107
talk 28
about 69
her 189
pet: 107
`Dinah's 156
our 12
cat. 168
And 175
she's 164
such 175
a 97
capital 48
one 182
for 177
catching 143
mice 94
you 39
can't 141
think! 81
And 175
oh, 139
I 73
wish 103
you 39
could 65
see 147
her 189
after 140
the 1
birds! 121
Why, 156
she'll 121
eat 184
a 97
little 2
bird 57
as 122
soon 187
as 122
look 47
at 123
it!' 193
This 158
speech 54
caused 117
a 97
remarkable 122
sensation 78
among 140
the 1
party. 0
Some 4
of 143
the 1
birds 82
hurried 83
off 135
at 123
once: 169
one 182
old 119
Magpie 71
began 49
wrapping 100
itself 129
up 139
very 54
carefully, 123
remarking, 170
`I 49
really 77
must 137
be 139
getting 108
home; 124
the 1
night-air 181
doesn't 66
suit 173
my 100
throat!' 170
and 127
a 97
Canary 136
called 163
out 14
in 165
a 97
trembling 2
voice 154
to 107
its 16
children, 3
`Come 164
away, 78
my 100
dears! 96
It's 143
high 66
time 141
you 39
were 25
all 73
in 165
bed!' 111
On 159
various 67
pretexts 157
they 152
all 73
moved 19
off, 29
and 127
Alice 168
was 81
soon 187
left 167
alone. 93
`I 49
wish 103
I 73
hadn't 120
mentioned 183
Dinah!' 34
she 40
said 137
to 107
herself 33
in 165
a 97
melancholy 190
tone. 124
`Nobody 75
seems 161
to 107
like 151
her, 103
down 170
here, 4
and 127
I'm 71
sure 37
she's 164
the 1
best 60
cat 62
in 165
the 1
world! 1
Oh, 187
my 100
dear 82
Dinah! 57
I 73
wonder 141
if 157
I 73
shall 52
ever 134
see 147
you 39
any 148
more!' 109
And 175
here 160
poor 18
Alice 168
began 49
to 107
cry 194
again, 100
for 177
she 40
felt 7
very 54
lonely 17
and 127
low-spirited. 75
In 173
a 97
little 2
while, 125
however, 138
she 40
again 192
heard 126
a 97
little 2
pattering 68
of 143
footsteps 111
in 165
the 1
distance, 167
and 127
she 40
looked 98
up 139
eagerly, 129
half 131
hoping 151
that 23
the 1
Mouse 21
had 51
changed 68
his 114
mind, 98
and 127
was 81
coming 79
back 111
to 107
finish 5
his 114
story. 143
CHAPTER 45
IV 149
The 49
Rabbit 110
Sends 59
in 165
a 97
Little 34
Bill 167
It 179
was 81
the 1
White 193
Rabbit, 118
trotting 49
slowly 34
back 111
again, 100
and 127
looking 187
anxiously 92
about 69
as 122
it 171
went, 40
as 122
if 157
it 171
had 51
lost 180
something; 199
and 127
she 40
heard 126
it 171
muttering 157
to 107
itself 129
`The 185
Duchess! 2
The 49
Duchess! 2
Oh 153
my 100
dear 82
paws! 36
Oh 153
my 100
fur 163
and 127
whiskers! 37
She'll 153
get 30
me 80
executed, 3
as 122
sure 37
as 122
ferrets 59
are 52
ferrets! 76
Where 87
CAN 80
I 73
have 40
dropped 184
them, 184
I 73
wonder?' 109
Alice 168
guessed 30
in 165
a 97
moment 0
that 23
it 171
was 81
looking 187
for 177
the 1
fan 139
and 127
the 1
pair 178
of 143
white 65
kid 182
gloves, 178
and 127
she 40
very 54
good-naturedly 54
began 49
hunting 63
about 69
for 177
them, 184
but 121
they 152
were 25
nowhere 22
to 107
be 139
seen--everything 138
seemed 39
to 107
have 40
changed 68
since 50
her 189
swim 88
in 165
the 1
pool, 16
and 127
the 1
great 21
hall, 91
with 134
the 1
glass 188
table 190
and 127
the 1
little 2
door, 150
had 51
vanished 182
completely. 72
Very 142
soon 187
the 1
Rabbit 110
noticed 124
Alice, 52
as 122
she 40
went 116
hunting 63
about, 113
and 127
called 163
out 14
to 107
her 189
in 165
an 117
angry 185
tone, 122
`Why, 172
Mary 179
Ann, 179
what 196
ARE 76
you 39
doing 119
out 14
here? 23
Run 139
home 15
this 70
moment, 12
and 127
fetch 82
me 80
a 97
pair 178
of 143
gloves 30
and 127
a 97
fan! 142
Quick, 153
now!' 132
And 175
Alice 168
was 81
so 76
much 29
frightened 154
that 23
she 40
ran 71
off 135
at 123
once 81
in 165
the 1
direction 49
it 171
pointed 49
to, 161
without 8
trying 57
to 107
explain 49
the 1
mistake 182
it 171
had 51
made. 193
`He 189
took 175
me 80
for 177
his 114
housemaid,' 178
she 40
said 137
to 107
herself 33
as 122
she 40
ran. 47
`How 88
surprised 83
he'll 10
be 139
when 114
he 125
finds 122
out 14
who 94
I 73
am! 29
But 169
I'd 62
better 0
take 191
him 108
his 114
fan 139
and 127
gloves--that 81
is, 114
if 157
I 73
can 56
find 97
them.' 91
As 130
she 40
said 137
this, 14
she 40
came 6
upon 130
a 97
neat 194
little 2
house, 124
on 151
the 1
door 126
of 143
which 141
was 81
a 97
bright 126
brass 129
plate 94
with 134
the 1
name 107
`W. 199
RABBIT' 13
engraved 104
upon 130
it. 147
She 88
went 116
in 165
without 8
knocking, 190
and 127
hurried 83
upstairs, 81
in 165
great 21
fear 64
lest 170
she 40
should 61
meet 127
the 1
real 150
Mary 179
Ann, 179
and 127
be 139
turned 108
out 14
of 143
the 1
house 88
before 89
she 40
had 51
found 90
the 1
fan 139
and 127
gloves. 180
`How 88
queer 126
it 171
seems,' 20
Alice 168
said 137
to 107
herself, 109
`to 163
be 139
going 82
messages 4
for 177
a 97
rabbit! 87
I 73
suppose 137
Dinah'll 31
be 139
sending 90
me 80
on 151
messages 4
next!' 7
And 175
she 40
began 49
fancying 193
the 1
sort 86
of 143
thing 118
that 23
would 85
happen: 32
`"Miss 194
Alice! 41
Come 148
here 160
directly, 122
and 127
get 30
ready 123
for 177
your 123
walk!" 78
"Coming 67
in 165
a 97
minute, 184
nurse! 76
But 169
I've 181
got 140
to 107
see 147
that 23
the 1
mouse 93
doesn't 66
get 30
out." 114
Only 68
I 73
don't 136
think,' 155
Alice 168
went 116
on, 125
`that 39
they'd 115
let 35
Dinah 104
stop 194
in 165
the 1
house 88
if 157
it 171
began 49
ordering 108
people 81
about 69
like 151
that!' 131
By 167
this 70
time 141
she 40
had 51
found 90
her 189
way 87
into 72
a 97
tidy 82
little 2
room 195
with 134
a 97
table 190
in 165
the 1
window, 108
and 127
on 151
it 171
(as 162
she 40
had 51
hoped) 167
a 97
fan 139
and 127
two 76
or 155
three 86
pairs 33
of 143
tiny 192
white 65
kid 182
gloves: 192
she 40
took 175
up 139
the 1
fan 139
and 127
a 97
pair 178
of 143
the 1
gloves, 178
and 127
was 81
just 164
going 82
to 107
leave 135
the 1
room, 89
when 114
her 189
eye 113
fell 199
upon 130
a 97
little 2
bottle 186
that 23
stood 83
near 192
the 1
looking- 46
glass. 22
There 124
was 81
no 121
label 12
this 70
time 141
with 134
the 1
words 169
`DRINK 64
ME,' 19
but 121
nevertheless 94
she 40
uncorked 99
it 171
and 127
put 175
it 171
to 107
her 189
lips. 166
`I 49
know 107
SOMETHING 94
interesting 24
is 170
sure 37
to 107
happen,' 117
she 40
said 137
to 107
herself, 109
`whenever 56
I 73
eat 184
or 155
drink 96
anything; 23
so 76
I'll 78
just 164
see 147
what 196
this 70
bottle 186
does. 173
I 73
do 11
hope 108
it'll 196
make 54
me 80
grow 187
large 43
again, 100
for 177
really 77
I'm 71
quite 22
tired 76
of 143
being 167
such 175
a 97
tiny 192
little 2
thing!' 140
It 179
did 55
so 76
indeed, 199
and 127
much 29
sooner 144
than 17
she 40
had 51
expected: 34
before 89
she 40
had 51
drunk 28
half 131
the 1
bottle, 38
she 40
found 90
her 189
head 32
pressing 17
against 23
the 1
ceiling, 81
and 127
had 51
to 107
stoop 95
to 107
save 141
her 189
neck 47
from 186
being 167
broken. 121
She 88
hastily 4
put 175
down 170
the 1
bottle, 38
saying 65
to 107
herself 33
`That's 51
quite 22
enough--I 111
hope 108
I 73
shan't 185
grow 187
any 148
more--As 17
it 171
is, 114
I 73
can't 141
get 30
out 14
at 123
the 1
door--I 163
do 11
wish 103
I 73
hadn't 120
drunk 28
quite 22
so 76
much!' 165
Alas! 108
it 171
was 81
too 28
late 142
to 107
wish 103
that! 146
She 88
went 116
on 151
growing, 165
and 127
growing, 165
and 127
very 54
soon 187
had 51
to 107
kneel 57
down 170
on 151
the 1
floor: 162
in 165
another 173
minute 188
there 196
was 81
not 67
even 130
room 195
for 177
this, 14
and 127
she 40
tried 146
the 1
effect 175
of 143
lying 197
down 170
with 134
one 182
elbow 187
against 23
the 1
door, 150
and 127
the 1
other 176
arm 60
curled 197
round 142
her 189
head. 38
Still 160
she 40
went 116
on 151
growing, 165
and, 181
as 122
a 97
last 126
resource, 154
she 40
put 175
one 182
arm 60
out 14
of 143
the 1
window, 108
and 127
one 182
foot 110
up 139
the 1
chimney, 147
and 127
said 137
to 107
herself 33
`Now 54
I 73
can 56
do 11
no 121
more, 119
whatever 186
happens. 125
What 84
WILL 2
become 17
of 143
me?' 72
Luckily 19
for 177
Alice, 52
the 1
little 2
magic 53
bottle 186
had 51
now 70
had 51
its 16
full 175
effect, 117
and 127
she 40
grew 77
no 121
larger: 93
still 32
it 171
was 81
very 54
uncomfortable, 153
and, 181
as 122
there 196
seemed 39
to 107
be 139
no 121
sort 86
of 143
chance 156
of 143
her 189
ever 134
getting 108
out 14
of 143
the 1
room 195
again, 100
no 121
wonder 141
she 40
felt 7
unhappy. 49
`It 35
was 81
much 29
pleasanter 105
at 123
home,' 78
thought 199
poor 18
Alice, 52
`when 130
one 182
wasn't 190
always 169
growing 23
larger 49
and 127
smaller, 184
and 127
being 167
ordered 123
about 69
by 159
mice 94
and 127
rabbits. 187
I 73
almost 10
wish 103
I 73
hadn't 120
gone 55
down 170
that 23
rabbit-hole--and 100
yet--and 17
yet--it's 159
rather 0
curious, 168
you 39
know, 161
this 70
sort 86
of 143
life! 109
I 73
do 11
wonder 141
what 196
CAN 80
have 40
happened 145
to 107
me! 113
When 2
I 73
used 93
to 107
read 142
fairy-tales, 185
I 73
fancied 48
that 23
kind 52
of 143
thing 118
never 44
happened, 157
and 127
now 70
here 160
I 73
am 116
in 165
the 1
middle 83
of 143
one! 75
There 124
ought 101
to 107
be 139
a 97
book 137
written 31
about 69
me, 124
that 23
there 196
ought! 132
And 175
when 114
I 73
grow 187
up, 153
I'll 78
write 175
one--but 179
I'm 71
grown 107
up 139
now,' 73
she 40
added 168
in 165
a 97
sorrowful 111
tone; 137
`at 179
least 57
there's 120
no 121
room 195
to 107
grow 187
up 139
any 148
more 125
HERE.' 57
`But 105
then,' 192
thought 199
Alice, 52
`shall 148
I 73
NEVER 84
get 30
any 148
older 4
than 17
I 73
am 116
now? 33
That'll 8
be 139
a 97
comfort, 192
one 182
way--never 61
to 107
be 139
an 117
old 119
woman-- 66
but 121
then--always 28
to 107
have 40
lessons 67
to 107
learn! 43
Oh, 187
I 73
shouldn't 72
like 151
THAT!' 99
`Oh, 123
you 39
foolish 56
Alice!' 166
she 40
answered 3
herself. 107
`How 88
can 56
you 39
learn 20
lessons 67
in 165
here? 23
Why, 156
there's 120
hardly 112
room 195
for 177
YOU, 197
and 127
no 121
room 195
at 123
all 73
for 177
any 148
lesson-books!' 77
And 175
so 76
she 40
went 116
on, 125
taking 188
first 32
one 182
side 71
and 127
then 141
the 1
other, 196
and 127
making 45
quite 22
a 97
conversation 99
of 143
it 171
altogether; 146
but 121
after 140
a 97
few 72
minutes 55
she 40
heard 126
a 97
voice 154
outside, 103
and 127
stopped 83
to 107
listen. 183
`Mary 195
Ann! 168
Mary 179
Ann!' 47
said 137
the 1
voice. 76
`Fetch 190
me 80
my 100
gloves 30
this 70
moment!' 194
Then 29
came 6
a 97
little 2
pattering 68
of 143
feet 190
on 151
the 1
stairs. 12
Alice 168
knew 197
it 171
was 81
the 1
Rabbit 110
coming 79
to 107
look 47
for 177
her, 103
and 127
she 40
trembled 55
till 117
she 40
shook 198
the 1
house, 124
quite 22
forgetting 141
that 23
she 40
was 81
now 70
about 69
a 97
thousand 70
times 86
as 122
large 43
as 122
the 1
Rabbit, 118
and 127
had 51
no 121
reason 68
to 107
be 139
afraid 161
of 143
it. 147
Presently 8
the 1
Rabbit 110
came 6
up 139
to 107
the 1
door, 150
and 127
tried 146
to 107
open 74
it; 160
but, 195
as 122
the 1
door 126
opened 151
inwards, 138
and 127
Alice's 28
elbow 187
was 81
pressed 86
hard 115
against 23
it, 145
that 23
attempt 179
proved 160
a 97
failure. 76
Alice 168
heard 126
it 171
say 43
to 107
itself 129
`Then 45
I'll 78
go 104
round 142
and 127
get 30
in 165
at 123
the 1
window.' 111
`THAT 151
you 39
won't' 172
thought 199
Alice, 52
and, 181
after 140
waiting 165
till 117
she 40
fancied 48
she 40
heard 126
the 1
Rabbit 110
just 164
under 112
the 1
window, 108
she 40
suddenly 40
spread 37
out 14
her 189
hand, 165
and 127
made 37
a 97
snatch 45
in 165
the 1
air. 12
She 88
did 55
not 67
get 30
hold 183
of 143
anything, 38
but 121
she 40
heard 126
a 97
little 2
shriek 30
and 127
a 97
fall, 49
and 127
a 97
crash 39
of 143
broken 35
glass, 24
from 186
which 141
she 40
concluded 39
that 23
it 171
was 81
just 164
possible 49
it 171
had 51
fallen 100
into 72
a 97
cucumber-frame, 118
or 155
something 182
of 143
the 1
sort. 112
Next 195
came 6
an 117
angry 185
voice--the 49
Rabbit's--`Pat! 80
Pat! 126
Where 87
are 52
you?' 71
And 175
then 141
a 97
voice 154
she 40
had 51
never 44
heard 126
before, 155
`Sure 141
then 141
I'm 71
here! 193
Digging 123
for 177
apples, 197
yer 126
honour!' 101
`Digging 107
for 177
apples, 197
indeed!' 123
said 137
the 1
Rabbit 110
angrily. 56
`Here! 79
Come 148
and 127
help 185
me 80
out 14
of 143
THIS!' 132
(Sounds 188
of 143
more 125
broken 35
glass.) 23
`Now 54
tell 73
me, 124
Pat, 137
what's 16
that 23
in 165
the 1
window?' 184
`Sure, 81
it's 55
an 117
arm, 104
yer 126
honour!' 101
(He 173
pronounced 11
it 171
`arrum.') 119
`An 181
arm, 104
you 39
goose! 32
Who 142
ever 134
saw 41
one 182
that 23
size? 6
Why, 156
it 171
fills 48
the 1
whole 183
window!' 114
`Sure, 81
it 171
does, 171
yer 126
honour: 13
but 121
it's 55
an 117
arm 60
for 177
all 73
that.' 128
`Well, 2
it's 55
got 140
no 121
business 112
there, 176
at 123
any 148
rate: 186
go 104
and 127
take 191
it 171
away!' 180
There 124
was 81
a 97
long 12
silence 105
after 140
this, 14
and 127
Alice 168
could 65
only 180
hear 46
whispers 55
now 70
and 127
then; 30
such 175
as, 26
`Sure, 81
I 73
don't 136
like 151
it, 145
yer 126
honour, 199
at 123
all, 107
at 123
all!' 15
`Do 75
as 122
I 73
tell 73
you, 53
you 39
coward!' 146
and 127
at 123
last 126
she 40
spread 37
out 14
her 189
hand 191
again, 100
and 127
made 37
another 173
snatch 45
in 165
the 1
air. 12
This 158
time 141
there 196
were 25
TWO 100
little 2
shrieks, 29
and 127
more 125
sounds 28
of 143
broken 35
glass. 22
`What 100
a 97
number 87
of 143
cucumber-frames 189
there 196
must 137
be!' 41
thought 199
Alice. 54
`I 49
wonder 141
what 196
they'll 33
do 11
next! 150
As 130
for 177
pulling 51
me 80
out 14
of 143
the 1
window, 108
I 73
only 180
wish 103
they 152
COULD! 88
I'm 71
sure 37
I 73
don't 136
want 72
to 107
stay 169
in 165
here 160
any 148
longer!' 177
She 88
waited 28
for 177
some 116
time 141
without 8
hearing 92
anything 54
more: 133
at 123
last 126
came 6
a 97
rumbling 14
of 143
little 2
cartwheels, 180
and 127
the 1
sound 63
of 143
a 97
good 85
many 167
voices 7
all 73
talking 34
together: 96
she 40
made 37
out 14
the 1
words: 199
`Where's 77
the 1
other 176
ladder?--Why, 177
I 73
hadn't 120
to 107
bring 50
but 121
one; 101
Bill's 11
got 140
the 1
other--Bill! 74
fetch 82
it 171
here, 4
lad!--Here, 194
put 175
'em 119
up 139
at 123
this 70
corner--No, 162
tie 32
'em 119
together 46
first--they 88
don't 136
reach 75
half 131
high 66
enough 0
yet--Oh! 168
they'll 33
do 11
well 46
enough; 77
don't 136
be 139
particular-- 131
Here, 132
Bill! 10
catch 155
hold 183
of 143
this 70
rope--Will 84
the 1
roof 188
bear?--Mind 149
that 23
loose 6
slate--Oh, 42
it's 55
coming 79
down! 103
Heads 35
below!' 137
(a 137
loud 26
crash)--`Now, 148
who 94
did 55
that?--It 3
was 81
Bill, 21
I 73
fancy--Who's 111
to 107
go 104
down 170
the 1
chimney?--Nay, 148
I 73
shan't! 170
YOU 63
do 11
it!--That 109
I 73
won't, 167
then!--Bill's 55
to 107
go 104
down--Here, 98
Bill! 10
the 1
master 14
says 48
you're 133
to 107
go 104
down 170
the 1
chimney!' 97
`Oh! 112
So 84
Bill's 11
got 140
to 107
come 60
down 170
the 1
chimney, 147
has 66
he?' 117
said 137
Alice 168
to 107
herself. 107
`Shy, 8
they 152
seem 66
to 107
put 175
everything 163
upon 130
Bill! 10
I 73
wouldn't 14
be 139
in 165
Bill's 11
place 167
for 177
a 97
good 85
deal: 14
this 70
fireplace 103
is 170
narrow, 121
to 107
be 139
sure; 6
but 121
I 73
THINK 162
I 73
can 56
kick 118
a 97
little!' 52
She 88
drew 104
her 189
foot 110
as 122
far 143
down 170
the 1
chimney 193
as 122
she 40
could, 37
and 127
waited 28
till 117
she 40
heard 126
a 97
little 2
animal 20
(she 80
couldn't 118
guess 151
of 143
what 196
sort 86
it 171
was) 152
scratching 192
and 127
scrambling 178
about 69
in 165
the 1
chimney 193
close 144
above 85
her: 117
then, 15
saying 65
to 107
herself 33
`This 174
is 170
Bill,' 90
she 40
gave 49
one 182
sharp 42
kick, 102
and 127
waited 28
to 107
see 147
what 196
would 85
happen 190
next. 163
The 49
first 32
thing 118
she 40
heard 126
was 81
a 97
general 48
chorus 66
of 143
`There 76
goes 190
Bill!' 149
then 141
the 1
Rabbit's 146
voice 154
along--`Catch 104
him, 192
you 39
by 159
the 1
hedge!' 59
then 141
silence, 59
and 127
then 141
another 173
confusion 154
of 143
voices--`Hold 74
up 139
his 114
head--Brandy 138
now--Don't 50
choke 132
him--How 44
was 81
it, 145
old 119
fellow? 80
What 84
happened 145
to 107
you? 72
Tell 161
us 142
all 73
about 69
it!' 193
Last 14
came 6
a 97
little 2
feeble, 97
squeaking 18
voice, 78
(`That's 181
Bill,' 90
thought 199
Alice,) 109
`Well, 2
I 73
hardly 112
know--No 148
more, 119
thank 34
ye; 71
I'm 71
better 0
now--but 43
I'm 71
a 97
deal 76
too 28
flustered 188
to 107
tell 73
you--all 102
I 73
know 107
is, 114
something 182
comes 175
at 123
me 80
like 151
a 97
Jack-in-the-box, 105
and 127
up 139
I 73
goes 190
like 151
a 97
sky-rocket!' 54
`So 140
you 39
did, 149
old 119
fellow!' 101
said 137
the 1
others. 157
`We 54
must 137
burn 199
the 1
house 88
down!' 64
said 137
the 1
Rabbit's 146
voice; 63
and 127
Alice 168
called 163
out 14
as 122
loud 26
as 122
she 40
could, 37
`If 21
you 39
do. 187
I'll 78
set 162
Dinah 104
at 123
you!' 141
There 124
was 81
a 97
dead 68
silence 105
instantly, 142
and 127
Alice 168
thought 199
to 107
herself, 109
`I 49
wonder 141
what 196
they 152
WILL 2
do 11
next! 150
If 165
they 152
had 51
any 148
sense, 10
they'd 115
take 191
the 1
roof 188
off.' 0
After 68
a 97
minute 188
or 155
two, 0
they 152
began 49
moving 50
about 69
again, 100
and 127
Alice 168
heard 126
the 1
Rabbit 110
say, 177
`A 41
barrowful 174
will 90
do, 185
to 107
begin 97
with.' 57
`A 41
barrowful 174
of 143
WHAT?' 116
thought 199
Alice; 67
but 121
she 40
had 51
not 67
long 12
to 107
doubt, 0
for 177
the 1
next 107
moment 0
a 97
shower 142
of 143
little 2
pebbles 171
came 6
rattling 13
in 165
at 123
the 1
window, 108
and 127
some 116
of 143
them 140
hit 115
her 189
in 165
the 1
face. 185
`I'll 94
put 175
a 97
stop 194
to 107
this,' 23
she 40
said 137
to 107
herself, 109
and 127
shouted 0
out, 78
`You'd 84
better 0
not 67
do 11
that 23
again!' 42
which 141
produced 188
another 173
dead 68
silence. 61
Alice 168
noticed 124
with 134
some 116
surprise 199
that 23
the 1
pebbles 171
were 25
all 73
turning 115
into 72
little 2
cakes 179
as 122
they 152
lay 116
on 151
the 1
floor, 176
and 127
a 97
bright 126
idea 183
came 6
into 72
her 189
head. 38
`If 21
I 73
eat 184
one 182
of 143
these 27
cakes,' 6
she 40
thought, 35
`it's 71
sure 37
to 107
make 54
SOME 28
change 32
in 165
my 100
size; 2
and 127
as 122
it 171
can't 141
possibly 69
make 54
me 80
larger, 107
it 171
must 137
make 54
me 80
smaller, 184
I 73
suppose.' 152
So 84
she 40
swallowed 172
one 182
of 143
the 1
cakes, 103
and 127
was 81
delighted 140
to 107
find 97
that 23
she 40
began 49
shrinking 121
directly. 120
As 130
soon 187
as 122
she 40
was 81
small 7
enough 0
to 107
get 30
through 171
the 1
door, 150
she 40
ran 71
out 14
of 143
the 1
house, 124
and 127
found 90
quite 22
a 97
crowd 13
of 143
little 2
animals 145
and 127
birds 82
waiting 165
outside. 105
The 49
poor 18
little 2
Lizard, 62
Bill, 21
was 81
in 165
the 1
middle, 39
being 167
held 173
up 139
by 159
two 76
guinea-pigs, 41
who 94
were 25
giving 82
it 171
something 182
out 14
of 143
a 97
bottle. 40
They 40
all 73
made 37
a 97
rush 80
at 123
Alice 168
the 1
moment 0
she 40
appeared; 175
but 121
she 40
ran 71
off 135
as 122
hard 115
as 122
she 40
could, 37
and 127
soon 187
found 90
herself 33
safe 45
in 165
a 97
thick 181
wood. 17
`The 185
first 32
thing 118
I've 181
got 140
to 107
do,' 174
said 137
Alice 168
to 107
herself, 109
as 122
she 40
wandered 84
about 69
in 165
the 1
wood, 15
`is 26
to 107
grow 187
to 107
my 100
right 172
size 153
again; 85
and 127
the 1
second 20
thing 118
is 170
to 107
find 97
my 100
way 87
into 72
that 23
lovely 89
garden. 111
I 73
think 122
that 23
will 90
be 139
the 1
best 60
plan.' 14
It 179
sounded 26
an 117
excellent 198
plan, 51
no 121
doubt, 0
and 127
very 54
neatly 193
and 127
simply 106
arranged; 117
the 1
only 180
difficulty 59
was, 155
that 23
she 40
had 51
not 67
the 1
smallest 81
idea 183
how 104
to 107
set 162
about 69
it; 160
and 127
while 17
she 40
was 81
peering 168
about 69
anxiously 92
among 140
the 1
trees, 25
a 97
little 2
sharp 42
bark 176
just 164
over 44
her 189
head 32
made 37
her 189
look 47
up 139
in 165
a 97
great 21
hurry. 110
An 125
enormous 188
puppy 124
was 81
looking 187
down 170
at 123
her 189
with 134
large 43
round 142
eyes, 2
and 127
feebly 135
stretching 179
out 14
one 182
paw, 142
trying 57
to 107
touch 47
her. 105
`Poor 122
little 2
thing!' 140
said 137
Alice, 52
in 165
a 97
coaxing 39
tone, 122
and 127
she 40
tried 146
hard 115
to 107
whistle 138
to 107
it; 160
but 121
she 40
was 81
terribly 73
frightened 154
all 73
the 1
time 141
at 123
the 1
thought 199
that 23
it 171
might 167
be 139
hungry, 111
in 165
which 141
case 192
it 171
would 85
be 139
very 54
likely 116
to 107
eat 184
her 189
up 139
in 165
spite 109
of 143
all 73
her 189
coaxing. 17
Hardly 144
knowing 153
what 196
she 40
did, 149
she 40
picked 112
up 139
a 97
little 2
bit 149
of 143
stick, 140
and 127
held 173
it 171
out 14
to 107
the 1
puppy; 193
whereupon 55
the 1
puppy 124
jumped 51
into 72
the 1
air 186
off 135
all 73
its 16
feet 190
at 123
once, 155
with 134
a 97
yelp 32
of 143
delight, 199
and 127
rushed 185
at 123
the 1
stick, 140
and 127
made 37
believe 84
to 107
worry 9
it; 160
then 141
Alice 168
dodged 51
behind 198
a 97
great 21
thistle, 149
to 107
keep 141
herself 33
from 186
being 167
run 91
over; 23
and 127
the 1
moment 0
she 40
appeared 164
on 151
the 1
other 176
side, 45
the 1
puppy 124
made 37
another 173
rush 80
at 123
the 1
stick, 140
and 127
tumbled 11
head 32
over 44
heels 199
in 165
its 16
hurry 140
to 107
get 30
hold 183
of 143
it; 160
then 141
Alice, 52
thinking 80
it 171
was 81
very 54
like 151
having 99
a 97
game 170
of 143
play 108
with 134
a 97
cart-horse, 148
and 127
expecting 33
every 75
moment 0
to 107
be 139
trampled 125
under 112
its 16
feet, 134
ran 71
round 142
the 1
thistle 105
again; 85
then 141
the 1
puppy 124
began 49
a 97
series 185
of 143
short 100
charges 47
at 123
the 1
stick, 140
running 135
a 97
very 54
little 2
way 87
forwards 30
each 81
time 141
and 127
a 97
long 12
way 87
back, 85
and 127
barking 182
hoarsely 169
all 73
the 1
while, 125
till 117
at 123
last 126
it 171
sat 38
down 170
a 97
good 85
way 87
off, 29
panting, 89
with 134
its 16
tongue 28
hanging 160
out 14
of 143
its 16
mouth, 115
and 127
its 16
great 21
eyes 18
half 131
shut. 58
This 158
seemed 39
to 107
Alice 168
a 97
good 85
opportunity 157
for 177
making 45
her 189
escape; 38
so 76
she 40
set 162
off 135
at 123
once, 155
and 127
ran 71
till 117
she 40
was 81
quite 22
tired 76
and 127
out 14
of 143
breath, 28
and 127
till 117
the 1
puppy's 16
bark 176
sounded 26
quite 22
faint 100
in 165
the 1
distance. 169
`And 111
yet 128
what 196
a 97
dear 82
little 2
puppy 124
it 171
was!' 103
said 137
Alice, 52
as 122
she 40
leant 102
against 23
a 97
buttercup 30
to 107
rest 116
herself, 109
and 127
fanned 6
herself 33
with 134
one 182
of 143
the 1
leaves: 150
`I 49
should 61
have 40
liked 181
teaching 75
it 171
tricks 160
very 54
much, 143
if--if 102
I'd 62
only 180
been 20
the 1
right 172
size 153
to 107
do 11
it! 134
Oh 153
dear! 175
I'd 62
nearly 115
forgotten 154
that 23
I've 181
got 140
to 107
grow 187
up 139
again! 111
Let 83
me 80
see--how 173
IS 146
it 171
to 107
be 139
managed? 176
I 73
suppose 137
I 73
ought 101
to 107
eat 184
or 155
drink 96
something 182
or 155
other; 181
but 121
the 1
great 21
question 106
is, 114
what?' 148
The 49
great 21
question 106
certainly 185
was, 155
what? 139
Alice 168
looked 98
all 73
round 142
her 189
at 123
the 1
flowers 72
and 127
the 1
blades 157
of 143
grass, 98
but 121
she 40
did 55
not 67
see 147
anything 54
that 23
looked 98
like 151
the 1
right 172
thing 118
to 107
eat 184
or 155
drink 96
under 112
the 1
circumstances. 74
There 124
was 81
a 97
large 43
mushroom 112
growing 23
near 192
her, 103
about 69
the 1
same 62
height 193
as 122
herself; 94
and 127
when 114
she 40
had 51
looked 98
under 112
it, 145
and 127
on 151
both 89
sides 116
of 143
it, 145
and 127
behind 198
it, 145
it 171
occurred 133
to 107
her 189
that 23
she 40
might 167
as 122
well 46
look 47
and 127
see 147
what 196
was 81
on 151
the 1
top 29
of 143
it. 147
She 88
stretched 188
herself 33
up 139
on 151
tiptoe, 195
and 127
peeped 9
over 44
the 1
edge 85
of 143
the 1
mushroom, 140
and 127
her 189
eyes 18
immediately 122
met 196
those 37
of 143
a 97
large 43
caterpillar, 137
that 23
was 81
sitting 76
on 151
the 1
top 29
with 134
its 16
arms 175
folded, 116
quietly 57
smoking 140
a 97
long 12
hookah, 26
and 127
taking 188
not 67
the 1
smallest 81
notice 24
of 143
her 189
or 155
of 143
anything 54
else. 141
CHAPTER 45
V 86
Advice 128
from 186
a 97
Caterpillar 13
The 49
Caterpillar 13
and 127
Alice 168
looked 98
at 123
each 81
other 176
for 177
some 116
time 141
in 165
silence: 73
at 123
last 126
the 1
Caterpillar 13
took 175
the 1
hookah 22
out 14
of 143
its 16
mouth, 115
and 127
addressed 19
her 189
in 165
a 97
languid, 134
sleepy 118
voice. 76
`Who 78
are 52
YOU?' 135
said 137
the 1
Caterpillar. 47
This 158
was 81
not 67
an 117
encouraging 82
opening 152
for 177
a 97
conversation. 35
Alice 168
replied, 117
rather 0
shyly, 53
`I--I 72
hardly 112
know, 161
sir, 48
just 164
at 123
present-- 189
at 123
least 57
I 73
know 107
who 94
I 73
WAS 105
when 114
I 73
got 140
up 139
this 70
morning, 96
but 121
I 73
think 122
I 73
must 137
have 40
been 20
changed 68
several 100
times 86
since 50
then.' 130
`What 100
do 11
you 39
mean 197
by 159
that?' 1
said 137
the 1
Caterpillar 13
sternly. 145
`Explain 47
yourself!' 91
`I 49
can't 141
explain 49
MYSELF, 84
I'm 71
afraid, 187
sir' 43
said 137
Alice, 52
`because 2
I'm 71
not 67
myself, 92
you 39
see.' 132
`I 49
don't 136
see,' 70
said 137
the 1
Caterpillar. 47
`I'm 7
afraid 161
I 73
can't 141
put 175
it 171
more 125
clearly,' 27
Alice 168
replied 97
very 54
politely, 174
`for 113
I 73
can't 141
understand 178
it 171
myself 120
to 107
begin 97
with; 13
and 127
being 167
so 76
many 167
different 9
sizes 58
in 165
a 97
day 28
is 170
very 54
confusing.' 55
`It 35
isn't,' 196
said 137
the 1
Caterpillar. 47
`Well, 2
perhaps 119
you 39
haven't 163
found 90
it 171
so 76
yet,' 11
said 137
Alice; 67
`but 57
when 114
you 39
have 40
to 107
turn 37
into 72
a 97
chrysalis--you 83
will 90
some 116
day, 112
you 39
know--and 28
then 141
after 140
that 23
into 72
a 97
butterfly, 177
I 73
should 61
think 122
you'll 112
feel 182
it 171
a 97
little 2
queer, 146
won't 35
you?' 71
`Not 51
a 97
bit,' 192
said 137
the 1
Caterpillar. 47
`Well, 2
perhaps 119
your 123
feelings 105
may 77
be 139
different,' 116
said 137
Alice; 67
`all 9
I 73
know 107
is, 114
it 171
would 85
feel 182
very 54
queer 126
to 107
ME.' 81
`You!' 131
said 137
the 1
Caterpillar 13
contemptuously. 75
`Who 78
are 52
YOU?' 135
Which 69
brought 37
them 140
back 111
again 192
to 107
the 1
beginning 115
of 143
the 1
conversation. 35
Alice 168
felt 7
a 97
little 2
irritated 38
at 123
the 1
Caterpillar's 9
making 45
such 175
VERY 166
short 100
remarks, 151
and 127
she 40
drew 104
herself 33
up 139
and 127
said, 91
very 54
gravely, 2
`I 49
think, 70
you 39
ought 101
to 107
tell 73
me 80
who 94
YOU 63
are, 56
first.' 95
`Why?' 136
said 137
the 1
Caterpillar. 47
Here 48
was 81
another 173
puzzling 107
question; 59
and 127
as 122
Alice 168
could 65
not 67
think 122
of 143
any 148
good 85
reason, 8
and 127
as 122
the 1
Caterpillar 13
seemed 39
to 107
be 139
in 165
a 97
VERY 166
unpleasant 83
state 185
of 143
mind, 98
she 40
turned 108
away. 80
`Come 164
back!' 163
the 1
Caterpillar 13
called 163
after 140
her. 105
`I've 197
something 182
important 78
to 107
say!' 185
This 158
sounded 26
promising, 4
certainly: 117
Alice 168
turned 108
and 127
came 6
back 111
again. 98
`Keep 45
your 123
temper,' 124
said 137
the 1
Caterpillar. 47
`Is 34
that 23
all?' 145
said 137
Alice, 52
swallowing 85
down 170
her 189
anger 175
as 122
well 46
as 122
she 40
could. 35
`No,' 188
said 137
the 1
Caterpillar. 47
Alice 168
thought 199
she 40
might 167
as 122
well 46
wait, 71
as 122
she 40
had 51
nothing 181
else 145
to 107
do, 185
and 127
perhaps 119
after 140
all 73
it 171
might 167
tell 73
her 189
something 182
worth 54
hearing. 78
For 25
some 116
minutes 55
it 171
puffed 92
away 14
without 8
speaking, 172
but 121
at 123
last 126
it 171
unfolded 119
its 16
arms, 69
took 175
the 1
hookah 22
out 14
of 143
its 16
mouth 127
again, 100
and 127
said, 91
`So 140
you 39
think 122
you're 133
changed, 72
do 11
you?' 71
`I'm 7
afraid 161
I 73
am, 40
sir,' 127
said 137
Alice; 67
`I 49
can't 141
remember 35
things 123
as 122
I 73
used--and 22
I 73
don't 136
keep 141
the 1
same 62
size 153
for 177
ten 117
minutes 55
together!' 64
`Can't 131
remember 35
WHAT 108
things?' 5
said 137
the 1
Caterpillar. 47
`Well, 2
I've 181
tried 146
to 107
say 43
"HOW 22
DOTH 183
THE 25
LITTLE 194
BUSY 153
BEE," 72
but 121
it 171
all 73
came 6
different!' 175
Alice 168
replied 97
in 165
a 97
very 54
melancholy 190
voice. 76
`Repeat, 119
"YOU 157
ARE 76
OLD, 77
FATHER 92
WILLIAM,"' 102
said 137
the 1
Caterpillar. 47
Alice 168
folded 104
her 189
hands, 136
and 127
began:-- 33
`You 23
are 52
old, 133
Father 52
William,' 150
the 1
young 192
man 66
said, 91
`And 111
your 123
hair 50
has 66
become 17
very 54
white; 22
And 175
yet 128
you 39
incessantly 75
stand 198
on 151
your 123
head-- 104
Do 19
you 39
think, 70
at 123
your 123
age, 85
it 171
is 170
right?' 180
`In 29
my 100
youth,' 74
Father 52
William 5
replied 97
to 107
his 114
son, 90
`I 49
feared 161
it 171
might 167
injure 13
the 1
brain; 3
But, 83
now 70
that 23
I'm 71
perfectly 162
sure 37
I 73
have 40
none, 196
Why, 156
I 73
do 11
it 171
again 192
and 127
again.' 39
`You 23
are 52
old,' 162
said 137
the 1
youth, 103
`as 178
I 73
mentioned 183
before, 155
And 175
have 40
grown 107
most 171
uncommonly 17
fat; 154
Yet 176
you 39
turned 108
a 97
back-somersault 113
in 165
at 123
the 1
door-- 170
Pray, 66
what 196
is 170
the 1
reason 68
of 143
that?' 1
`In 29
my 100
youth,' 74
said 137
the 1
sage, 0
as 122
he 125
shook 198
his 114
grey 79
locks, 12
`I 49
kept 86
all 73
my 100
limbs 25
very 54
supple 101
By 167
the 1
use 103
of 143
this 70
ointment--one 184
shilling 106
the 1
box-- 19
Allow 41
me 80
to 107
sell 82
you 39
a 97
couple?' 88
`You 23
are 52
old,' 162
said 137
the 1
youth, 103
`and 63
your 123
jaws 67
are 52
too 28
weak 104
For 25
anything 54
tougher 24
than 17
suet; 178
Yet 176
you 39
finished 14
the 1
goose, 21
with 134
the 1
bones 15
and 127
the 1
beak-- 83
Pray 162
how 104
did 55
you 39
manage 179
to 107
do 11
it?' 123
`In 29
my 100
youth,' 74
said 137
his 114
father, 64
`I 49
took 175
to 107
the 1
law, 178
And 175
argued 114
each 81
case 192
with 134
my 100
wife; 66
And 175
the 1
muscular 168
strength, 181
which 141
it 171
gave 49
to 107
my 100
jaw, 196
Has 114
lasted 179
the 1
rest 116
of 143
my 100
life.' 75
`You 23
are 52
old,' 162
said 137
the 1
youth, 103
`one 118
would 85
hardly 112
suppose 137
That 111
your 123
eye 113
was 81
as 122
steady 166
as 122
ever; 13
Yet 176
you 39
balanced 144
an 117
eel 100
on 151
the 1
end 171
of 143
your 123
nose-- 189
What 84
made 37
you 39
so 76
awfully 44
clever?' 31
`I 49
have 40
answered 3
three 86
questions, 199
and 127
that 23
is 170
enough,' 139
Said 25
his 114
father; 49
`don't 64
give 137
yourself 145
airs! 144
Do 19
you 39
think 122
I 73
can 56
listen 1
all 73
day 28
to 107
such 175
stuff? 101
Be 147
off, 29
or 155
I'll 78
kick 118
you 39
down 170
stairs!' 8
`That 127
is 170
not 67
said 137
right,' 191
said 137
the 1
Caterpillar. 47
`Not 51
QUITE 62
right, 120
I'm 71
afraid,' 10
said 137
Alice, 52
timidly; 93
`some 132
of 143
the 1
words 169
have 40
got 140
altered.' 122
`It 35
is 170
wrong 157
from 186
beginning 115
to 107
end,' 134
said 137
the 1
Caterpillar 13
decidedly, 171
and 127
there 196
was 81
silence 105
for 177
some 116
minutes. 17
The 49
Caterpillar 13
was 81
the 1
first 32
to 107
speak. 108
`What 100
size 153
do 11
you 39
want 72
to 107
be?' 171
it 171
asked. 90
`Oh, 123
I'm 71
not 67
particular 5
as 122
to 107
size,' 60
Alice 168
hastily 4
replied; 102
`only 196
one 182
doesn't 66
like 151
changing 85
so 76
often, 122
you 39
know.' 4
`I 49
DON'T 168
know,' 66
said 137
the 1
Caterpillar. 47
Alice 168
said 137
nothing: 29
she 40
had 51
never 44
been 20
so 76
much 29
contradicted 178
in 165
her 189
life 196
before, 155
and 127
she 40
felt 7
that 23
she 40
was 81
losing 174
her 189
temper. 131
`Are 36
you 39
content 17
now?' 62
said 137
the 1
Caterpillar. 47
`Well, 2
I 73
should 61
like 151
to 107
be 139
a 97
LITTLE 194
larger, 107
sir, 48
if 157
you 39
wouldn't 14
mind,' 19
said 137
Alice: 66
`three 114
inches 32
is 170
such 175
a 97
wretched 138
height 193
to 107
be.' 44
`It 35
is 170
a 97
very 54
good 85
height 193
indeed!' 123
said 137
the 1
Caterpillar 13
angrily, 58
rearing 110
itself 129
upright 39
as 122
it 171
spoke 196
(it 11
was 81
exactly 20
three 86
inches 32
high). 153
`But 105
I'm 71
not 67
used 93
to 107
it!' 193
pleaded 45
poor 18
Alice 168
in 165
a 97
piteous 37
tone. 124
And 175
she 40
thought 199
of 143
herself, 109
`I 49
wish 103
the 1
creatures 68
wouldn't 14
be 139
so 76
easily 169
offended!' 193
`You'll 8
get 30
used 93
to 107
it 171
in 165
time,' 192
said 137
the 1
Caterpillar; 34
and 127
it 171
put 175
the 1
hookah 22
into 72
its 16
mouth 127
and 127
began 49
smoking 140
again. 98
This 158
time 141
Alice 168
waited 28
patiently 166
until 6
it 171
chose 180
to 107
speak 82
again. 98
In 173
a 97
minute 188
or 155
two 76
the 1
Caterpillar 13
took 175
the 1
hookah 22
out 14
of 143
its 16
mouth 127
and 127
yawned 18
once 81
or 155
twice, 12
and 127
shook 198
itself. 111
Then 29
it 171
got 140
down 170
off 135
the 1
mushroom, 140
and 127
crawled 102
away 14
in 165
the 1
grass, 98
merely 112
remarking 42
as 122
it 171
went, 40
`One 166
side 71
will 90
make 54
you 39
grow 187
taller, 22
and 127
the 1
other 176
side 71
will 90
make 54
you 39
grow 187
shorter.' 182
`One 166
side 71
of 143
WHAT? 11
The 49
other 176
side 71
of 143
WHAT?' 116
thought 199
Alice 168
to 107
herself. 107
`Of 7
the 1
mushroom,' 109
said 137
the 1
Caterpillar, 49
just 164
as 122
if 157
she 40
had 51
asked 160
it 171
aloud; 184
and 127
in 165
another 173
moment 0
it 171
was 81
out 14
of 143
sight. 167
Alice 168
remained 165
looking 187
thoughtfully 87
at 123
the 1
mushroom 112
for 177
a 97
minute, 184
trying 57
to 107
make 54
out 14
which 141
were 25
the 1
two 76
sides 116
of 143
it; 160
and 127
as 122
it 171
was 81
perfectly 162
round, 50
she 40
found 90
this 70
a 97
very 54
difficult 142
question. 72
However, 10
at 123
last 126
she 40
stretched 188
her 189
arms 175
round 142
it 171
as 122
far 143
as 122
they 152
would 85
go, 68
and 127
broke 121
off 135
a 97
bit 149
of 143
the 1
edge 85
with 134
each 81
hand. 167
`And 111
now 70
which 141
is 170
which?' 93
she 40
said 137
to 107
herself, 109
and 127
nibbled 152
a 97
little 2
of 143
the 1
right-hand 144
bit 149
to 107
try 131
the 1
effect: 103
the 1
next 107
moment 0
she 40
felt 7
a 97
violent 59
blow 66
underneath 58
her 189
chin: 16
it 171
had 51
struck 108
her 189
foot! 43
She 88
was 81
a 97
good 85
deal 76
frightened 154
by 159
this 70
very 54
sudden 133
change, 12
but 121
she 40
felt 7
that 23
there 196
was 81
no 121
time 141
to 107
be 139
lost, 24
as 122
she 40
was 81
shrinking 121
rapidly; 130
so 76
she 40
set 162
to 107
work 41
at 123
once 81
to 107
eat 184
some 116
of 143
the 1
other 176
bit. 65
Her 37
chin 18
was 81
pressed 86
so 76
closely 37
against 23
her 189
foot, 54
that 23
there 196
was 81
hardly 112
room 195
to 107
open 74
her 189
mouth; 100
but 121
she 40
did 55
it 171
at 123
last, 150
and 127
managed 119
to 107
swallow 3
a 97
morsel 78
of 143
the 1
lefthand 150
bit. 65
`Come, 168
my 100
head's 20
free 68
at 123
last!' 148
said 137
Alice 168
in 165
a 97
tone 138
of 143
delight, 199
which 141
changed 68
into 72
alarm 25
in 165
another 173
moment, 12
when 114
she 40
found 90
that 23
her 189
shoulders 197
were 25
nowhere 22
to 107
be 139
found: 48
all 73
she 40
could 65
see, 1
when 114
she 40
looked 98
down, 114
was 81
an 117
immense 108
length 74
of 143
neck, 101
which 141
seemed 39
to 107
rise 145
like 151
a 97
stalk 143
out 14
of 143
a 97
sea 143
of 143
green 139
leaves 196
that 23
lay 116
far 143
below 97
her. 105
`What 100
CAN 80
all 73
that 23
green 139
stuff 172
be?' 171
said 137
Alice. 54
`And 111
where 159
HAVE 152
my 100
shoulders 197
got 140
to? 180
And 175
oh, 139
my 100
poor 18
hands, 136
how 104
is 170
it 171
I 73
can't 141
see 147
you?' 71
She 88
was 81
moving 50
them 140
about 69
as 122
she 40
spoke, 176
but 121
no 121
result 195
seemed 39
to 107
follow, 189
except 167
a 97
little 2
shaking 107
among 140
the 1
distant 153
green 139
leaves. 138
As 130
there 196
seemed 39
to 107
be 139
no 121
chance 156
of 143
getting 108
her 189
hands 36
up 139
to 107
her 189
head, 36
she 40
tried 146
to 107
get 30
her 189
head 32
down 170
to 107
them, 184
and 127
was 81
delighted 140
to 107
find 97
that 23
her 189
neck 47
would 85
bend 89
about 69
easily 169
in 165
any 148
direction, 197
like 151
a 97
serpent. 187
She 88
had 51
just 164
succeeded 41
in 165
curving 20
it 171
down 170
into 72
a 97
graceful 77
zigzag, 140
and 127
was 81
going 82
to 107
dive 164
in 165
among 140
the 1
leaves, 136
which 141
she 40
found 90
to 107
be 139
nothing 181
but 121
the 1
tops 14
of 143
the 1
trees 117
under 112
which 141
she 40
had 51
been 20
wandering, 129
when 114
a 97
sharp 42
hiss 49
made 37
her 189
draw 180
back 111
in 165
a 97
hurry: 98
a 97
large 43
pigeon 194
had 51
flown 40
into 72
her 189
face, 183
and 127
was 81
beating 116
her 189
violently 16
with 134
its 16
wings. 18
`Serpent!' 55
screamed 42
the 1
Pigeon. 184
`I'm 7
NOT 91
a 97
serpent!' 127
said 137
Alice 168
indignantly. 101
`Let 19
me 80
alone!' 87
`Serpent, 95
I 73
say 43
again!' 42
repeated 190
the 1
Pigeon, 182
but 121
in 165
a 97
more 125
subdued 192
tone, 122
and 127
added 168
with 134
a 97
kind 52
of 143
sob, 118
`I've 197
tried 146
every 75
way, 141
and 127
nothing 181
seems 161
to 107
suit 173
them!' 94
`I 49
haven't 163
the 1
least 57
idea 183
what 196
you're 133
talking 34
about,' 104
said 137
Alice. 54
`I've 197
tried 146
the 1
roots 177
of 143
trees, 25
and 127
I've 181
tried 146
banks, 115
and 127
I've 181
tried 146
hedges,' 151
the 1
Pigeon 26
went 116
on, 125
without 8
attending 152
to 107
her; 118
`but 57
those 37
serpents! 191
There's 160
no 121
pleasing 111
them!' 94
Alice 168
was 81
more 125
and 127
more 125
puzzled, 94
but 121
she 40
thought 199
there 196
was 81
no 121
use 103
in 165
saying 65
anything 54
more 125
till 117
the 1
Pigeon 26
had 51
finished. 92
`As 186
if 157
it 171
wasn't 190
trouble 185
enough 0
hatching 26
the 1
eggs,' 191
said 137
the 1
Pigeon; 197
`but 57
I 73
must 137
be 139
on 151
the 1
look-out 40
for 177
serpents 56
night 88
and 127
day! 101
Why, 156
I 73
haven't 163
had 51
a 97
wink 151
of 143
sleep 47
these 27
three 86
weeks!' 125
`I'm 7
very 54
sorry 125
you've 9
been 20
annoyed,' 53
said 137
Alice, 52
who 94
was 81
beginning 115
to 107
see 147
its 16
meaning. 79
`And 111
just 164
as 122
I'd 62
taken 31
the 1
highest 36
tree 142
in 165
the 1
wood,' 192
continued 35
the 1
Pigeon, 182
raising 65
its 16
voice 154
to 107
a 97
shriek, 186
`and 63
just 164
as 122
I 73
was 81
thinking 80
I 73
should 61
be 139
free 68
of 143
them 140
at 123
last, 150
they 152
must 137
needs 77
come 60
wriggling 164
down 170
from 186
the 1
sky! 176
Ugh, 86
Serpent!' 41
`But 105
I'm 71
NOT 91
a 97
serpent, 185
I 73
tell 73
you!' 141
said 137
Alice. 54
`I'm 7
a--I'm 138
a--' 6
`Well! 13
WHAT 108
are 52
you?' 71
said 137
the 1
Pigeon. 184
`I 49
can 56
see 147
you're 133
trying 57
to 107
invent 6
something!' 144
`I--I'm 190
a 97
little 2
girl,' 73
said 137
Alice, 52
rather 0
doubtfully, 142
as 122
she 40
remembered 28
the 1
number 87
of 143
changes 83
she 40
had 51
gone 55
through 171
that 23
day. 114
`A 41
likely 116
story 197
indeed!' 123
said 137
the 1
Pigeon 26
in 165
a 97
tone 138
of 143
the 1
deepest 90
contempt. 104
`I've 197
seen 67
a 97
good 85
many 167
little 2
girls 135
in 165
my 100
time, 15
but 121
never 44
ONE 6
with 134
such 175
a 97
neck 47
as 122
that! 146
No, 43
no! 184
You're 165
a 97
serpent; 0
and 127
there's 120
no 121
use 103
denying 174
it. 147
I 73
suppose 137
you'll 112
be 139
telling 39
me 80
next 107
that 23
you 39
never 44
tasted 171
an 117
egg!' 139
`I 49
HAVE 152
tasted 171
eggs, 86
certainly,' 38
said 137
Alice, 52
who 94
was 81
a 97
very 54
truthful 2
child; 161
`but 57
little 2
girls 135
eat 184
eggs 182
quite 22
as 122
much 29
as 122
serpents 56
do, 185
you 39
know.' 4
`I 49
don't 136
believe 84
it,' 134
said 137
the 1
Pigeon; 197
`but 57
if 157
they 152
do, 185
why 104
then 141
they're 54
a 97
kind 52
of 143
serpent, 185
that's 69
all 73
I 73
can 56
say.' 188
This 158
was 81
such 175
a 97
new 160
idea 183
to 107
Alice, 52
that 23
she 40
was 81
quite 22
silent 11
for 177
a 97
minute 188
or 155
two, 0
which 141
gave 49
the 1
Pigeon 26
the 1
opportunity 157
of 143
adding, 157
`You're 187
looking 187
for 177
eggs, 86
I 73
know 107
THAT 135
well 46
enough; 77
and 127
what 196
does 17
it 171
matter 23
to 107
me 80
whether 109
you're 133
a 97
little 2
girl 20
or 155
a 97
serpent?' 197
`It 35
matters 170
a 97
good 85
deal 76
to 107
ME,' 19
said 137
Alice 168
hastily; 103
`but 57
I'm 71
not 67
looking 187
for 177
eggs, 86
as 122
it 171
happens; 138
and 127
if 157
I 73
was, 155
I 73
shouldn't 72
want 72
YOURS: 30
I 73
don't 136
like 151
them 140
raw.' 145
`Well, 2
be 139
off, 29
then!' 133
said 137
the 1
Pigeon 26
in 165
a 97
sulky 88
tone, 122
as 122
it 171
settled 73
down 170
again 192
into 72
its 16
nest. 158
Alice 168
crouched 57
down 170
among 140
the 1
trees 117
as 122
well 46
as 122
she 40
could, 37
for 177
her 189
neck 47
kept 86
getting 108
entangled 60
among 140
the 1
branches, 100
and 127
every 75
now 70
and 127
then 141
she 40
had 51
to 107
stop 194
and 127
untwist 162
it. 147
After 68
a 97
while 17
she 40
remembered 28
that 23
she 40
still 32
held 173
the 1
pieces 3
of 143
mushroom 112
in 165
her 189
hands, 136
and 127
she 40
set 162
to 107
work 41
very 54
carefully, 123
nibbling 25
first 32
at 123
one 182
and 127
then 141
at 123
the 1
other, 196
and 127
growing 23
sometimes 14
taller 182
and 127
sometimes 14
shorter, 125
until 6
she 40
had 51
succeeded 41
in 165
bringing 176
herself 33
down 170
to 107
her 189
usual 74
height. 127
It 179
was 81
so 76
long 12
since 50
she 40
had 51
been 20
anything 54
near 192
the 1
right 172
size, 187
that 23
it 171
felt 7
quite 22
strange 44
at 123
first; 45
but 121
she 40
got 140
used 93
to 107
it 171
in 165
a 97
few 72
minutes, 19
and 127
began 49
talking 34
to 107
herself, 109
as 122
usual. 156
`Come, 168
there's 120
half 131
my 100
plan 97
done 82
now! 3
How 152
puzzling 107
all 73
these 27
changes 83
are! 45
I'm 71
never 44
sure 37
what 196
I'm 71
going 82
to 107
be, 153
from 186
one 182
minute 188
to 107
another! 154
However, 10
I've 181
got 140
back 111
to 107
my 100
right 172
size: 1
the 1
next 107
thing 118
is, 114
to 107
get 30
into 72
that 23
beautiful 183
garden--how 141
IS 146
that 23
to 107
be 139
done, 186
I 73
wonder?' 109
As 130
she 40
said 137
this, 14
she 40
came 6
suddenly 40
upon 130
an 117
open 74
place, 75
with 134
a 97
little 2
house 88
in 165
it 171
about 69
four 94
feet 190
high. 92
`Whoever 92
lives 167
there,' 41
thought 199
Alice, 52
`it'll 4
never 44
do 11
to 107
come 60
upon 130
them 140
THIS 182
size: 1
why, 68
I 73
should 61
frighten 33
them 140
out 14
of 143
their 130
wits!' 89
So 84
she 40
began 49
nibbling 25
at 123
the 1
righthand 165
bit 149
again, 100
and 127
did 55
not 67
venture 147
to 107
go 104
near 192
the 1
house 88
till 117
she 40
had 51
brought 37
herself 33
down 170
to 107
nine 26
inches 32
high. 92
CHAPTER 45
VI 139
Pig 38
and 127
Pepper 126
For 25
a 97
minute 188
or 155
two 76
she 40
stood 83
looking 187
at 123
the 1
house, 124
and 127
wondering 183
what 196
to 107
do 11
next, 161
when 114
suddenly 40
a 97
footman 36
in 165
livery 29
came 6
running 135
out 14
of 143
the 1
wood--(she 27
considered 120
him 108
to 107
be 139
a 97
footman 36
because 18
he 125
was 81
in 165
livery: 127
otherwise, 144
judging 164
by 159
his 114
face 69
only, 24
she 40
would 85
have 40
called 163
him 108
a 97
fish)--and 138
rapped 90
loudly 41
at 123
the 1
door 126
with 134
his 114
knuckles. 78
It 179
was 81
opened 151
by 159
another 173
footman 36
in 165
livery, 113
with 134
a 97
round 142
face, 183
and 127
large 43
eyes 18
like 151
a 97
frog; 39
and 127
both 89
footmen, 52
Alice 168
noticed, 48
had 51
powdered 32
hair 50
that 23
curled 197
all 73
over 44
their 130
heads. 133
She 88
felt 7
very 54
curious 132
to 107
know 107
what 196
it 171
was 81
all 73
about, 113
and 127
crept 2
a 97
little 2
way 87
out 14
of 143
the 1
wood 141
to 107
listen. 183
The 49
Fish-Footman 161
began 49
by 159
producing 99
from 186
under 112
his 114
arm 60
a 97
great 21
letter, 22
nearly 115
as 122
large 43
as 122
himself, 36
and 127
this 70
he 125
handed 114
over 44
to 107
the 1
other, 196
saying, 101
in 165
a 97
solemn 122
tone, 122
`For 161
the 1
Duchess. 15
An 125
invitation 121
from 186
the 1
Queen 50
to 107
play 108
croquet.' 108
The 49
Frog-Footman 75
repeated, 158
in 165
the 1
same 62
solemn 122
tone, 122
only 180
changing 85
the 1
order 150
of 143
the 1
words 169
a 97
little, 150
`From 90
the 1
Queen. 100
An 125
invitation 121
for 177
the 1
Duchess 81
to 107
play 108
croquet.' 108
Then 29
they 152
both 89
bowed 49
low, 32
and 127
their 130
curls 143
got 140
entangled 60
together. 84
Alice 168
laughed 8
so 76
much 29
at 123
this, 14
that 23
she 40
had 51
to 107
run 91
back 111
into 72
the 1
wood 141
for 177
fear 64
of 143
their 130
hearing 92
her; 118
and 127
when 114
she 40
next 107
peeped 9
out 14
the 1
Fish-Footman 161
was 81
gone, 149
and 127
the 1
other 176
was 81
sitting 76
on 151
the 1
ground 1
near 192
the 1
door, 150
staring 40
stupidly 148
up 139
into 72
the 1
sky. 189
Alice 168
went 116
timidly 136
up 139
to 107
the 1
door, 150
and 127
knocked. 93
`There's 176
no 121
sort 86
of 143
use 103
in 165
knocking,' 57
said 137
the 1
Footman, 136
`and 63
that 23
for 177
two 76
reasons. 73
First, 4
because 18
I'm 71
on 151
the 1
same 62
side 71
of 143
the 1
door 126
as 122
you 39
are; 71
secondly, 181
because 18
they're 54
making 45
such 175
a 97
noise 82
inside, 48
no 121
one 182
could 65
possibly 69
hear 46
you.' 144
And 175
certainly 185
there 196
was 81
a 97
most 171
extraordinary 138
noise 82
going 82
on 151
within--a 198
constant 164
howling 118
and 127
sneezing, 127
and 127
every 75
now 70
and 127
then 141
a 97
great 21
crash, 43
as 122
if 157
a 97
dish 74
or 155
kettle 37
had 51
been 20
broken 35
to 107
pieces. 175
`Please, 10
then,' 192
said 137
Alice, 52
`how 40
am 116
I 73
to 107
get 30
in?' 157
`There 76
might 167
be 139
some 116
sense 182
in 165
your 123
knocking,' 57
the 1
Footman 44
went 116
on 151
without 8
attending 152
to 107
her, 103
`if 13
we 190
had 51
the 1
door 126
between 160
us. 48
For 25
instance, 127
if 157
you 39
were 25
INSIDE, 128
you 39
might 167
knock, 128
and 127
I 73
could 65
let 35
you 39
out, 78
you 39
know.' 4
He 133
was 81
looking 187
up 139
into 72
the 1
sky 153
all 73
the 1
time 141
he 125
was 81
speaking, 172
and 127
this 70
Alice 168
thought 199
decidedly 49
uncivil. 20
`But 105
perhaps 119
he 125
can't 141
help 185
it,' 134
she 40
said 137
to 107
herself; 94
`his 50
eyes 18
are 52
so 76
VERY 166
nearly 115
at 123
the 1
top 29
of 143
his 114
head. 38
But 169
at 123
any 148
rate 88
he 125
might 167
answer 170
questions.--How 175
am 116
I 73
to 107
get 30
in?' 157
she 40
repeated, 158
aloud. 197
`I 49
shall 52
sit 86
here,' 133
the 1
Footman 44
remarked, 29
`till 133
tomorrow--' 14
At 131
this 70
moment 0
the 1
door 126
of 143
the 1
house 88
opened, 165
and 127
a 97
large 43
plate 94
came 6
skimming 49
out, 78
straight 34
at 123
the 1
Footman's 88
head: 50
it 171
just 164
grazed 149
his 114
nose, 1
and 127
broke 121
to 107
pieces 3
against 23
one 182
of 143
the 1
trees 117
behind 198
him. 194
`--or 11
next 107
day, 112
maybe,' 91
the 1
Footman 44
continued 35
in 165
the 1
same 62
tone, 122
exactly 20
as 122
if 157
nothing 181
had 51
happened. 155
`How 88
am 116
I 73
to 107
get 30
in?' 157
asked 160
Alice 168
again, 100
in 165
a 97
louder 65
tone. 124
`ARE 12
you 39
to 107
get 30
in 165
at 123
all?' 145
said 137
the 1
Footman. 138
`That's 51
the 1
first 32
question, 74
you 39
know.' 4
It 179
was, 155
no 121
doubt: 186
only 180
Alice 168
did 55
not 67
like 151
to 107
be 139
told 75
so. 2
`It's 159
really 77
dreadful,' 126
she 40
muttered 196
to 107
herself, 109
`the 137
way 87
all 73
the 1
creatures 68
argue. 168
It's 143
enough 0
to 107
drive 138
one 182
crazy!' 199
The 49
Footman 44
seemed 39
to 107
think 122
this 70
a 97
good 85
opportunity 157
for 177
repeating 145
his 114
remark, 12
with 134
variations. 106
`I 49
shall 52
sit 86
here,' 133
he 125
said, 91
`on 7
and 127
off, 29
for 177
days 183
and 127
days.' 168
`But 105
what 196
am 116
I 73
to 107
do?' 163
said 137
Alice. 54
`Anything 134
you 39
like,' 182
said 137
the 1
Footman, 136
and 127
began 49
whistling. 97
`Oh, 123
there's 120
no 121
use 103
in 165
talking 34
to 107
him,' 191
said 137
Alice 168
desperately: 154
`he's 65
perfectly 162
idiotic!' 181
And 175
she 40
opened 151
the 1
door 126
and 127
went 116
in. 161
The 49
door 126
led 19
right 172
into 72
a 97
large 43
kitchen, 112
which 141
was 81
full 175
of 143
smoke 23
from 186
one 182
end 171
to 107
the 1
other: 182
the 1
Duchess 81
was 81
sitting 76
on 151
a 97
three-legged 183
stool 91
in 165
the 1
middle, 39
nursing 150
a 97
baby; 173
the 1
cook 128
was 81
leaning 156
over 44
the 1
fire, 126
stirring 146
a 97
large 43
cauldron 106
which 141
seemed 39
to 107
be 139
full 175
of 143
soup. 71
`There's 176
certainly 185
too 28
much 29
pepper 94
in 165
that 23
soup!' 59
Alice 168
said 137
to 107
herself, 109
as 122
well 46
as 122
she 40
could 65
for 177
sneezing. 125
There 124
was 81
certainly 185
too 28
much 29
of 143
it 171
in 165
the 1
air. 12
Even 18
the 1
Duchess 81
sneezed 90
occasionally; 140
and 127
as 122
for 177
the 1
baby, 158
it 171
was 81
sneezing 107
and 127
howling 118
alternately 185
without 8
a 97
moment's 132
pause. 8
The 49
only 180
things 123
in 165
the 1
kitchen 156
that 23
did 55
not 67
sneeze, 146
were 25
the 1
cook, 12
and 127
a 97
large 43
cat 62
which 141
was 81
sitting 76
on 151
the 1
hearth 190
and 127
grinning 196
from 186
ear 182
to 107
ear. 88
`Please 178
would 85
you 39
tell 73
me,' 83
said 137
Alice, 52
a 97
little 2
timidly, 108
for 177
she 40
was 81
not 67
quite 22
sure 37
whether 109
it 171
was 81
good 85
manners 98
for 177
her 189
to 107
speak 82
first, 60
`why 40
your 123
cat 62
grins 67
like 151
that?' 1
`It's 159
a 97
Cheshire 135
cat,' 185
said 137
the 1
Duchess, 13
`and 63
that's 69
why. 70
Pig!' 180
She 88
said 137
the 1
last 126
word 34
with 134
such 175
sudden 133
violence 115
that 23
Alice 168
quite 22
jumped; 154
but 121
she 40
saw 41
in 165
another 173
moment 0
that 23
it 171
was 81
addressed 19
to 107
the 1
baby, 158
and 127
not 67
to 107
her, 103
so 76
she 40
took 175
courage, 42
and 127
went 116
on 151
again:-- 122
`I 49
didn't 156
know 107
that 23
Cheshire 135
cats 37
always 169
grinned; 198
in 165
fact, 48
I 73
didn't 156
know 107
that 23
cats 37
COULD 105
grin.' 119
`They 56
all 73
can,' 19
said 137
the 1
Duchess; 28
`and 63
most 171
of 143
'em 119
do.' 36
`I 49
don't 136
know 107
of 143
any 148
that 23
do,' 174
Alice 168
said 137
very 54
politely, 174
feeling 132
quite 22
pleased 30
to 107
have 40
got 140
into 72
a 97
conversation. 35
`You 23
don't 136
know 107
much,' 24
said 137
the 1
Duchess; 28
`and 63
that's 69
a 97
fact.' 107
Alice 168
did 55
not 67
at 123
all 73
like 151
the 1
tone 138
of 143
this 70
remark, 12
and 127
thought 199
it 171
would 85
be 139
as 122
well 46
to 107
introduce 183
some 116
other 176
subject 68
of 143
conversation. 35
While 145
she 40
was 81
trying 57
to 107
fix 197
on 151
one, 86
the 1
cook 128
took 175
the 1
cauldron 106
of 143
soup 175
off 135
the 1
fire, 126
and 127
at 123
once 81
set 162
to 107
work 41
throwing 52
everything 163
within 157
her 189
reach 75
at 123
the 1
Duchess 81
and 127
the 1
baby 94
--the 41
fire-irons 108
came 6
first; 45
then 141
followed 88
a 97
shower 142
of 143
saucepans, 131
plates, 161
and 127
dishes. 190
The 49
Duchess 81
took 175
no 121
notice 24
of 143
them 140
even 130
when 114
they 152
hit 115
her; 118
and 127
the 1
baby 94
was 81
howling 118
so 76
much 29
already, 148
that 23
it 171
was 81
quite 22
impossible 43
to 107
say 43
whether 109
the 1
blows 161
hurt 151
it 171
or 155
not. 123
`Oh, 123
PLEASE 134
mind 34
what 196
you're 133
doing!' 5
cried 89
Alice, 52
jumping 156
up 139
and 127
down 170
in 165
an 117
agony 12
of 143
terror. 134
`Oh, 123
there 196
goes 190
his 114
PRECIOUS 52
nose'; 161
as 122
an 117
unusually 142
large 43
saucepan 60
flew 120
close 144
by 159
it, 145
and 127
very 54
nearly 115
carried 154
it 171
off. 31
`If 21
everybody 21
minded 191
their 130
own 70
business,' 43
the 1
Duchess 81
said 137
in 165
a 97
hoarse 14
growl, 197
`the 137
world 2
would 85
go 104
round 142
a 97
deal 76
faster 71
than 17
it 171
does.' 94
`Which 131
would 85
NOT 91
be 139
an 117
advantage,' 110
said 137
Alice, 52
who 94
felt 7
very 54
glad 168
to 107
get 30
an 117
opportunity 157
of 143
showing 93
off 135
a 97
little 2
of 143
her 189
knowledge. 24
`Just 68
think 122
of 143
what 196
work 41
it 171
would 85
make 54
with 134
the 1
day 28
and 127
night! 135
You 87
see 147
the 1
earth 2
takes 36
twenty-four 54
hours 71
to 107
turn 37
round 142
on 151
its 16
axis--' 90
`Talking 138
of 143
axes,' 120
said 137
the 1
Duchess, 13
`chop 22
off 135
her 189
head!' 82
Alice 168
glanced 56
rather 0
anxiously 92
at 123
the 1
cook, 12
to 107
see 147
if 157
she 40
meant 23
to 107
take 191
the 1
hint; 4
but 121
the 1
cook 128
was 81
busily 2
stirring 146
the 1
soup, 69
and 127
seemed 39
not 67
to 107
be 139
listening, 17
so 76
she 40
went 116
on 151
again: 86
`Twenty-four 122
hours, 51
I 73
THINK; 15
or 155
is 170
it 171
twelve? 194
I--' 22
`Oh, 123
don't 136
bother 122
ME,' 19
said 137
the 1
Duchess; 28
`I 49
never 44
could 65
abide 161
figures!' 91
And 175
with 134
that 23
she 40
began 49
nursing 150
her 189
child 196
again, 100
singing 67
a 97
sort 86
of 143
lullaby 79
to 107
it 171
as 122
she 40
did 55
so, 0
and 127
giving 82
it 171
a 97
violent 59
shake 14
at 123
the 1
end 171
of 143
every 75
line: 22
`Speak 190
roughly 134
to 107
your 123
little 2
boy, 184
And 175
beat 102
him 108
when 114
he 125
sneezes: 173
He 133
only 180
does 17
it 171
to 107
annoy, 63
Because 62
he 125
knows 32
it 171
teases.' 150
CHORUS. 80
(In 13
which 141
the 1
cook 128
and 127
the 1
baby 94
joined):-- 178
`Wow! 26
wow! 122
wow!' 21
While 145
the 1
Duchess 81
sang 95
the 1
second 20
verse 189
of 143
the 1
song, 63
she 40
kept 86
tossing 145
the 1
baby 94
violently 16
up 139
and 127
down, 114
and 127
the 1
poor 18
little 2
thing 118
howled 13
so, 0
that 23
Alice 168
could 65
hardly 112
hear 46
the 1
words:-- 1
`I 49
speak 82
severely 121
to 107
my 100
boy, 184
I 73
beat 102
him 108
when 114
he 125
sneezes; 174
For 25
he 125
can 56
thoroughly 171
enjoy 59
The 49
pepper 94
when 114
he 125
pleases!' 7
CHORUS. 80
`Wow! 26
wow! 122
wow!' 21
`Here! 79
you 39
may 77
nurse 77
it 171
a 97
bit, 63
if 157
you 39
like!' 123
the 1
Duchess 81
said 137
to 107
Alice, 52
flinging 30
the 1
baby 94
at 123
her 189
as 122
she 40
spoke. 174
`I 49
must 137
go 104
and 127
get 30
ready 123
to 107
play 108
croquet 115
with 134
the 1
Queen,' 75
and 127
she 40
hurried 83
out 14
of 143
the 1
room. 91
The 49
cook 128
threw 104
a 97
frying-pan 59
after 140
her 189
as 122
she 40
went 116
out, 78
but 121
it 171
just 164
missed 21
her. 105
Alice 168
caught 140
the 1
baby 94
with 134
some 116
difficulty, 25
as 122
it 171
was 81
a 97
queer- 145
shaped 157
little 2
creature, 197
and 127
held 173
out 14
its 16
arms 175
and 127
legs 197
in 165
all 73
directions, 40
`just 180
like 151
a 97
star-fish,' 126
thought 199
Alice. 54
The 49
poor 18
little 2
thing 118
was 81
snorting 44
like 151
a 97
steam-engine 9
when 114
she 40
caught 140
it, 145
and 127
kept 86
doubling 118
itself 129
up 139
and 127
straightening 119
itself 129
out 14
again, 100
so 76
that 23
altogether, 161
for 177
the 1
first 32
minute 188
or 155
two, 0
it 171
was 81
as 122
much 29
as 122
she 40
could 65
do 11
to 107
hold 183
it. 147
As 130
soon 187
as 122
she 40
had 51
made 37
out 14
the 1
proper 112
way 87
of 143
nursing 150
it, 145
(which 181
was 81
to 107
twist 151
it 171
up 139
into 72
a 97
sort 86
of 143
knot, 68
and 127
then 141
keep 141
tight 14
hold 183
of 143
its 16
right 172
ear 182
and 127
left 167
foot, 54
so 76
as 122
to 107
prevent 72
its 16
undoing 194
itself,) 180
she 40
carried 154
it 171
out 14
into 72
the 1
open 74
air. 12
`IF 189
I 73
don't 136
take 191
this 70
child 196
away 14
with 134
me,' 83
thought 199
Alice, 52
`they're 38
sure 37
to 107
kill 198
it 171
in 165
a 97
day 28
or 155
two: 14
wouldn't 14
it 171
be 139
murder 161
to 107
leave 135
it 171
behind?' 66
She 88
said 137
the 1
last 126
words 169
out 14
loud, 50
and 127
the 1
little 2
thing 118
grunted 119
in 165
reply 186
(it 11
had 51
left 167
off 135
sneezing 107
by 159
this 70
time). 78
`Don't 136
grunt,' 91
said 137
Alice; 67
`that's 13
not 67
at 123
all 73
a 97
proper 112
way 87
of 143
expressing 102
yourself.' 88
The 49
baby 94
grunted 119
again, 100
and 127
Alice 168
looked 98
very 54
anxiously 92
into 72
its 16
face 69
to 107
see 147
what 196
was 81
the 1
matter 23
with 134
it. 147
There 124
could 65
be 139
no 121
doubt 92
that 23
it 171
had 51
a 97
VERY 166
turn-up 149
nose, 1
much 29
more 125
like 151
a 97
snout 139
than 17
a 97
real 150
nose; 16
also 191
its 16
eyes 18
were 25
getting 108
extremely 159
small 7
for 177
a 97
baby: 172
altogether 35
Alice 168
did 55
not 67
like 151
the 1
look 47
of 143
the 1
thing 118
at 123
all. 109
`But 105
perhaps 119
it 171
was 81
only 180
sobbing,' 151
she 40
thought, 35
and 127
looked 98
into 72
its 16
eyes 18
again, 100
to 107
see 147
if 157
there 196
were 25
any 148
tears. 67
No, 43
there 196
were 25
no 121
tears. 67
`If 21
you're 133
going 82
to 107
turn 37
into 72
a 97
pig, 134
my 100
dear,' 91
said 137
Alice, 52
seriously, 93
`I'll 94
have 40
nothing 181
more 125
to 107
do 11
with 134
you. 55
Mind 122
now!' 132
The 49
poor 18
little 2
thing 118
sobbed 173
again 192
(or 195
grunted, 141
it 171
was 81
impossible 43
to 107
say 43
which), 16
and 127
they 152
went 116
on 151
for 177
some 116
while 17
in 165
silence. 61
Alice 168
was 81
just 164
beginning 115
to 107
think 122
to 107
herself, 109
`Now, 118
what 196
am 116
I 73
to 107
do 11
with 134
this 70
creature 71
when 114
I 73
get 30
it 171
home?' 89
when 114
it 171
grunted 119
again, 100
so 76
violently, 100
that 23
she 40
looked 98
down 170
into 72
its 16
face 69
in 165
some 116
alarm. 75
This 158
time 141
there 196
could 65
be 139
NO 97
mistake 182
about 69
it: 159
it 171
was 81
neither 3
more 125
nor 65
less 169
than 17
a 97
pig, 134
and 127
she 40
felt 7
that 23
it 171
would 85
be 139
quite 22
absurd 155
for 177
her 189
to 107
carry 115
it 171
further. 66
So 84
she 40
set 162
the 1
little 2
creature 71
down, 114
and 127
felt 7
quite 22
relieved 24
to 107
see 147
it 171
trot 67
away 14
quietly 57
into 72
the 1
wood. 17
`If 21
it 171
had 51
grown 107
up,' 182
she 40
said 137
to 107
herself, 109
`it 27
would 85
have 40
made 37
a 97
dreadfully 192
ugly 199
child: 162
but 121
it 171
makes 189
rather 0
a 97
handsome 75
pig, 134
I 73
think.' 93
And 175
she 40
began 49
thinking 80
over 44
other 176
children 55
she 40
knew, 151
who 94
might 167
do 11
very 54
well 46
as 122
pigs, 199
and 127
was 81
just 164
saying 65
to 107
herself, 109
`if 13
one 182
only 180
knew 197
the 1
right 172
way 87
to 107
change 32
them--' 181
when 114
she 40
was 81
a 97
little 2
startled 121
by 159
seeing 1
the 1
Cheshire 135
Cat 110
sitting 76
on 151
a 97
bough 193
of 143
a 97
tree 142
a 97
few 72
yards 137
off. 31
The 49
Cat 110
only 180
grinned 101
when 114
it 171
saw 41
Alice. 54
It 179
looked 98
good- 80
natured, 119
she 40
thought: 49
still 32
it 171
had 51
VERY 166
long 12
claws 28
and 127
a 97
great 21
many 167
teeth, 124
so 76
she 40
felt 7
that 23
it 171
ought 101
to 107
be 139
treated 135
with 134
respect. 168
`Cheshire 73
Puss,' 176
she 40
began, 133
rather 0
timidly, 108
as 122
she 40
did 55
not 67
at 123
all 73
know 107
whether 109
it 171
would 85
like 151
the 1
name: 175
however, 138
it 171
only 180
grinned 101
a 97
little 2
wider. 81
`Come, 168
it's 55
pleased 30
so 76
far,' 26
thought 199
Alice, 52
and 127
she 40
went 116
on. 127
`Would 187
you 39
tell 73
me, 124
please, 86
which 141
way 87
I 73
ought 101
to 107
go 104
from 186
here?' 144
`That 127
depends 103
a 97
good 85
deal 76
on 151
where 159
you 39
want 72
to 107
get 30
to,' 30
said 137
the 1
Cat. 56
`I 49
don't 136
much 29
care 161
where--' 184
said 137
Alice. 54
`Then 45
it 171
doesn't 66
matter 23
which 141
way 87
you 39
go,' 147
said 137
the 1
Cat. 56
`--so 132
long 12
as 122
I 73
get 30
SOMEWHERE,' 82
Alice 168
added 168
as 122
an 117
explanation. 5
`Oh, 123
you're 133
sure 37
to 107
do 11
that,' 190
said 137
the 1
Cat, 54
`if 13
you 39
only 180
walk 1
long 12
enough.' 1
Alice 168
felt 7
that 23
this 70
could 65
not 67
be 139
denied, 105
so 76
she 40
tried 146
another 173
question. 72
`What 100
sort 86
of 143
people 81
live 92
about 69
here?' 144
`In 29
THAT 135
direction,' 46
the 1
Cat 110
said, 91
waving 34
its 16
right 172
paw 158
round, 50
`lives 33
a 97
Hatter: 12
and 127
in 165
THAT 135
direction,' 46
waving 34
the 1
other 176
paw, 142
`lives 33
a 97
March 171
Hare. 170
Visit 147
either 195
you 39
like: 139
they're 54
both 89
mad.' 81
`But 105
I 73
don't 136
want 72
to 107
go 104
among 140
mad 56
people,' 74
Alice 168
remarked. 31
`Oh, 123
you 39
can't 141
help 185
that,' 190
said 137
the 1
Cat: 68
`we're 196
all 73
mad 56
here. 6
I'm 71
mad. 182
You're 165
mad.' 81
`How 88
do 11
you 39
know 107
I'm 71
mad?' 8
said 137
Alice. 54
`You 23
must 137
be,' 182
said 137
the 1
Cat, 54
`or 11
you 39
wouldn't 14
have 40
come 60
here.' 71
Alice 168
didn't 156
think 122
that 23
proved 160
it 171
at 123
all; 122
however, 138
she 40
went 116
on 151
`And 111
how 104
do 11
you 39
know 107
that 23
you're 133
mad?' 8
`To 171
begin 97
with,' 119
said 137
the 1
Cat, 54
`a 73
dog's 8
not 67
mad. 182
You 87
grant 180
that?' 1
`I 49
suppose 137
so,' 39
said 137
Alice. 54
`Well, 2
then,' 192
the 1
Cat 110
went 116
on, 125
`you 175
see, 1
a 97
dog 44
growls 126
when 114
it's 55
angry, 117
and 127
wags 54
its 16
tail 136
when 114
it's 55
pleased. 100
Now 118
I 73
growl 105
when 114
I'm 71
pleased, 98
and 127
wag 69
my 100
tail 136
when 114
I'm 71
angry. 115
Therefore 32
I'm 71
mad.' 81
`I 49
call 182
it 171
purring, 87
not 67
growling,' 92
said 137
Alice. 54
`Call 86
it 171
what 196
you 39
like,' 182
said 137
the 1
Cat. 56
`Do 75
you 39
play 108
croquet 115
with 134
the 1
Queen 50
to-day?' 26
`I 49
should 61
like 151
it 171
very 54
much,' 24
said 137
Alice, 52
`but 57
I 73
haven't 163
been 20
invited 43
yet.' 73
`You'll 8
see 147
me 80
there,' 41
said 137
the 1
Cat, 54
and 127
vanished. 164
Alice 168
was 81
not 67
much 29
surprised 83
at 123
this, 14
she 40
was 81
getting 108
so 76
used 93
to 107
queer 126
things 123
happening. 178
While 145
she 40
was 81
looking 187
at 123
the 1
place 167
where 159
it 171
had 51
been, 64
it 171
suddenly 40
appeared 164
again. 98
`By-the-bye, 24
what 196
became 71
of 143
the 1
baby?' 170
said 137
the 1
Cat. 56
`I'd 198
nearly 115
forgotten 154
to 107
ask.' 194
`It 35
turned 108
into 72
a 97
pig,' 193
Alice 168
quietly 57
said, 91
just 164
as 122
if 157
it 171
had 51
come 60
back 111
in 165
a 97
natural 1
way. 143
`I 49
thought 199
it 171
would,' 88
said 137
the 1
Cat, 54
and 127
vanished 182
again. 98
Alice 168
waited 28
a 97
little, 150
half 131
expecting 33
to 107
see 147
it 171
again, 100
but 121
it 171
did 55
not 67
appear, 9
and 127
after 140
a 97
minute 188
or 155
two 76
she 40
walked 104
on 151
in 165
the 1
direction 49
in 165
which 141
the 1
March 171
Hare 4
was 81
said 137
to 107
live. 98
`I've 197
seen 67
hatters 61
before,' 26
she 40
said 137
to 107
herself; 94
`the 137
March 171
Hare 4
will 90
be 139
much 29
the 1
most 171
interesting, 44
and 127
perhaps 119
as 122
this 70
is 170
May 125
it 171
won't 35
be 139
raving 189
mad--at 131
least 57
not 67
so 76
mad 56
as 122
it 171
was 81
in 165
March.' 36
As 130
she 40
said 137
this, 14
she 40
looked 98
up, 153
and 127
there 196
was 81
the 1
Cat 110
again, 100
sitting 76
on 151
a 97
branch 94
of 143
a 97
tree. 48
`Did 39
you 39
say 43
pig, 134
or 155
fig?' 172
said 137
the 1
Cat. 56
`I 49
said 137
pig,' 193
replied 97
Alice; 67
`and 63
I 73
wish 103
you 39
wouldn't 14
keep 141
appearing 173
and 127
vanishing 175
so 76
suddenly: 58
you 39
make 54
one 182
quite 22
giddy.' 32
`All 57
right,' 191
said 137
the 1
Cat; 69
and 127
this 70
time 141
it 171
vanished 182
quite 22
slowly, 34
beginning 115
with 134
the 1
end 171
of 143
the 1
tail, 60
and 127
ending 17
with 134
the 1
grin, 196
which 141
remained 165
some 116
time 141
after 140
the 1
rest 116
of 143
it 171
had 51
gone. 151
`Well! 13
I've 181
often 30
seen 67
a 97
cat 62
without 8
a 97
grin,' 181
thought 199
Alice; 67
`but 57
a 97
grin 192
without 8
a 97
cat! 155
It's 143
the 1
most 171
curious 132
thing 118
I 73
ever 134
saw 41
in 165
my 100
life!' 78
She 88
had 51
not 67
gone 55
much 29
farther 64
before 89
she 40
came 6
in 165
sight 93
of 143
the 1
house 88
of 143
the 1
March 171
Hare: 182
she 40
thought 199
it 171
must 137
be 139
the 1
right 172
house, 124
because 18
the 1
chimneys 18
were 25
shaped 157
like 151
ears 157
and 127
the 1
roof 188
was 81
thatched 27
with 134
fur. 99
It 179
was 81
so 76
large 43
a 97
house, 124
that 23
she 40
did 55
not 67
like 151
to 107
go 104
nearer 139
till 117
she 40
had 51
nibbled 152
some 116
more 125
of 143
the 1
lefthand 150
bit 149
of 143
mushroom, 140
and 127
raised 144
herself 33
to 107
about 69
two 76
feet 190
high: 104
even 130
then 141
she 40
walked 104
up 139
towards 148
it 171
rather 0
timidly, 108
saying 65
to 107
herself 33
`Suppose 41
it 171
should 61
be 139
raving 189
mad 56
after 140
all! 96
I 73
almost 10
wish 103
I'd 62
gone 55
to 107
see 147
the 1
Hatter 10
instead!' 176
CHAPTER 45
VII 182
A 65
Mad 104
Tea-Party 23
There 124
was 81
a 97
table 190
set 162
out 14
under 112
a 97
tree 142
in 165
front 113
of 143
the 1
house, 124
and 127
the 1
March 171
Hare 4
and 127
the 1
Hatter 10
were 25
having 99
tea 104
at 123
it: 159
a 97
Dormouse 182
was 81
sitting 76
between 160
them, 184
fast 180
asleep, 58
and 127
the 1
other 176
two 76
were 25
using 140
it 171
as 122
a 97
cushion, 131
resting 70
their 130
elbows 184
on 151
it, 145
and 127
talking 34
over 44
its 16
head. 38
`Very 158
uncomfortable 45
for 177
the 1
Dormouse,' 87
thought 199
Alice; 67
`only, 176
as 122
it's 55
asleep, 58
I 73
suppose 137
it 171
doesn't 66
mind.' 157
The 49
table 190
was 81
a 97
large 43
one, 86
but 121
the 1
three 86
were 25
all 73
crowded 108
together 46
at 123
one 182
corner 187
of 143
it: 159
`No 185
room! 78
No 129
room!' 39
they 152
cried 89
out 14
when 114
they 152
saw 41
Alice 168
coming. 157
`There's 176
PLENTY 190
of 143
room!' 39
said 137
Alice 168
indignantly, 103
and 127
she 40
sat 38
down 170
in 165
a 97
large 43
arm-chair 44
at 123
one 182
end 171
of 143
the 1
table. 160
`Have 144
some 116
wine,' 148
the 1
March 171
Hare 4
said 137
in 165
an 117
encouraging 82
tone. 124
Alice 168
looked 98
all 73
round 142
the 1
table, 162
but 121
there 196
was 81
nothing 181
on 151
it 171
but 121
tea. 70
`I 49
don't 136
see 147
any 148
wine,' 148
she 40
remarked. 31
`There 76
isn't 105
any,' 31
said 137
the 1
March 171
Hare. 170
`Then 45
it 171
wasn't 190
very 54
civil 195
of 143
you 39
to 107
offer 180
it,' 134
said 137
Alice 168
angrily. 56
`It 35
wasn't 190
very 54
civil 195
of 143
you 39
to 107
sit 86
down 170
without 8
being 167
invited,' 18
said 137
the 1
March 171
Hare. 170
`I 49
didn't 156
know 107
it 171
was 81
YOUR 35
table,' 7
said 137
Alice; 67
`it's 71
laid 0
for 177
a 97
great 21
many 167
more 125
than 17
three.' 89
`Your 27
hair 50
wants 147
cutting,' 5
said 137
the 1
Hatter. 24
He 133
had 51
been 20
looking 187
at 123
Alice 168
for 177
some 116
time 141
with 134
great 21
curiosity, 109
and 127
this 70
was 81
his 114
first 32
speech. 52
`You 23
should 61
learn 20
not 67
to 107
make 54
personal 24
remarks,' 142
Alice 168
said 137
with 134
some 116
severity; 194
`it's 71
very 54
rude.' 99
The 49
Hatter 10
opened 151
his 114
eyes 18
very 54
wide 35
on 151
hearing 92
this; 29
but 121
all 73
he 125
SAID 49
was, 155
`Why 88
is 170
a 97
raven 160
like 151
a 97
writing-desk?' 86
`Come, 168
we 190
shall 52
have 40
some 116
fun 159
now!' 132
thought 199
Alice. 54
`I'm 7
glad 168
they've 130
begun 69
asking 79
riddles.--I 38
believe 84
I 73
can 56
guess 151
that,' 190
she 40
added 168
aloud. 197
`Do 75
you 39
mean 197
that 23
you 39
think 122
you 39
can 56
find 97
out 14
the 1
answer 170
to 107
it?' 123
said 137
the 1
March 171
Hare. 170
`Exactly 76
so,' 39
said 137
Alice. 54
`Then 45
you 39
should 61
say 43
what 196
you 39
mean,' 176
the 1
March 171
Hare 4
went 116
on. 127
`I 49
do,' 174
Alice 168
hastily 4
replied; 102
`at 179
least--at 116
least 57
I 73
mean 197
what 196
I 73
say--that's 146
the 1
same 62
thing, 194
you 39
know.' 4
`Not 51
the 1
same 62
thing 118
a 97
bit!' 51
said 137
the 1
Hatter. 24
`You 23
might 167
just 164
as 122
well 46
say 43
that 23
"I 127
see 147
what 196
I 73
eat" 138
is 170
the 1
same 62
thing 118
as 122
"I 127
eat 184
what 196
I 73
see"!' 83
`You 23
might 167
just 164
as 122
well 46
say,' 126
added 168
the 1
March 171
Hare, 168
`that 39
"I 127
like 151
what 196
I 73
get" 164
is 170
the 1
same 62
thing 118
as 122
"I 127
get 30
what 196
I 73
like"!' 169
`You 23
might 167
just 164
as 122
well 46
say,' 126
added 168
the 1
Dormouse, 74
who 94
seemed 39
to 107
be 139
talking 34
in 165
his 114
sleep, 195
`that 39
"I 127
breathe 85
when 114
I 73
sleep" 5
is 170
the 1
same 62
thing 118
as 122
"I 127
sleep 47
when 114
I 73
breathe"!' 83
`It 35
IS 146
the 1
same 62
thing 118
with 134
you,' 82
said 137
the 1
Hatter, 26
and 127
here 160
the 1
conversation 99
dropped, 196
and 127
the 1
party 150
sat 38
silent 11
for 177
a 97
minute, 184
while 17
Alice 168
thought 199
over 44
all 73
she 40
could 65
remember 35
about 69
ravens 21
and 127
writing-desks, 69
which 141
wasn't 190
much. 145
The 49
Hatter 10
was 81
the 1
first 32
to 107
break 7
the 1
silence. 61
`What 100
day 28
of 143
the 1
month 0
is 170
it?' 123
he 125
said, 91
turning 115
to 107
Alice: 66
he 125
had 51
taken 31
his 114
watch 175
out 14
of 143
his 114
pocket, 154
and 127
was 81
looking 187
at 123
it 171
uneasily, 172
shaking 107
it 171
every 75
now 70
and 127
then, 15
and 127
holding 59
it 171
to 107
his 114
ear. 88
Alice 168
considered 120
a 97
little, 150
and 127
then 141
said 137
`The 185
fourth.' 147
`Two 60
days 183
wrong!' 139
sighed 178
the 1
Hatter. 24
`I 49
told 75
you 39
butter 64
wouldn't 14
suit 173
the 1
works!' 8
he 125
added 168
looking 187
angrily 138
at 123
the 1
March 171
Hare. 170
`It 35
was 81
the 1
BEST 172
butter,' 133
the 1
March 171
Hare 4
meekly 29
replied. 115
`Yes, 85
but 121
some 116
crumbs 104
must 137
have 40
got 140
in 165
as 122
well,' 87
the 1
Hatter 10
grumbled: 146
`you 175
shouldn't 72
have 40
put 175
it 171
in 165
with 134
the 1
bread-knife.' 97
The 49
March 171
Hare 4
took 175
the 1
watch 175
and 127
looked 98
at 123
it 171
gloomily: 180
then 141
he 125
dipped 36
it 171
into 72
his 114
cup 78
of 143
tea, 68
and 127
looked 98
at 123
it 171
again: 86
but 121
he 125
could 65
think 122
of 143
nothing 181
better 0
to 107
say 43
than 17
his 114
first 32
remark, 12
`It 35
was 81
the 1
BEST 172
butter, 20
you 39
know.' 4
Alice 168
had 51
been 20
looking 187
over 44
his 114
shoulder 184
with 134
some 116
curiosity. 107
`What 100
a 97
funny 130
watch!' 37
she 40
remarked. 31
`It 35
tells 178
the 1
day 28
of 143
the 1
month, 52
and 127
doesn't 66
tell 73
what 196
o'clock 126
it 171
is!' 32
`Why 88
should 61
it?' 123
muttered 196
the 1
Hatter. 24
`Does 121
YOUR 35
watch 175
tell 73
you 39
what 196
year 93
it 171
is?' 162
`Of 7
course 149
not,' 190
Alice 168
replied 97
very 54
readily: 158
`but 57
that's 69
because 18
it 171
stays 154
the 1
same 62
year 93
for 177
such 175
a 97
long 12
time 141
together.' 67
`Which 131
is 170
just 164
the 1
case 192
with 134
MINE,' 26
said 137
the 1
Hatter. 24
Alice 168
felt 7
dreadfully 192
puzzled. 96
The 49
Hatter's 98
remark 184
seemed 39
to 107
have 40
no 121
sort 86
of 143
meaning 37
in 165
it, 145
and 127
yet 128
it 171
was 81
certainly 185
English. 190
`I 49
don't 136
quite 22
understand 178
you,' 82
she 40
said, 91
as 122
politely 186
as 122
she 40
could. 35
`The 185
Dormouse 182
is 170
asleep 2
again,' 101
said 137
the 1
Hatter, 26
and 127
he 125
poured 21
a 97
little 2
hot 101
tea 104
upon 130
its 16
nose. 3
The 49
Dormouse 182
shook 198
its 16
head 32
impatiently, 182
and 127
said, 91
without 8
opening 152
its 16
eyes, 2
`Of 7
course, 185
of 143
course; 0
just 164
what 196
I 73
was 81
going 82
to 107
remark 184
myself.' 97
`Have 144
you 39
guessed 30
the 1
riddle 128
yet?' 0
the 1
Hatter 10
said, 91
turning 115
to 107
Alice 168
again. 98
`No, 179
I 73
give 137
it 171
up,' 182
Alice 168
replied: 103
`what's 160
the 1
answer?' 42
`I 49
haven't 163
the 1
slightest 53
idea,' 30
said 137
the 1
Hatter. 24
`Nor 49
I,' 156
said 137
the 1
March 171
Hare. 170
Alice 168
sighed 178
wearily. 193
`I 49
think 122
you 39
might 167
do 11
something 182
better 0
with 134
the 1
time,' 192
she 40
said, 91
`than 33
waste 138
it 171
in 165
asking 79
riddles 19
that 23
have 40
no 121
answers.' 110
`If 21
you 39
knew 197
Time 29
as 122
well 46
as 122
I 73
do,' 174
said 137
the 1
Hatter, 26
`you 175
wouldn't 14
talk 28
about 69
wasting 175
IT. 3
It's 143
HIM.' 117
`I 49
don't 136
know 107
what 196
you 39
mean,' 176
said 137
Alice. 54
`Of 7
course 149
you 39
don't!' 142
the 1
Hatter 10
said, 91
tossing 145
his 114
head 32
contemptuously. 75
`I 49
dare 152
say 43
you 39
never 44
even 130
spoke 196
to 107
Time!' 165
`Perhaps 177
not,' 190
Alice 168
cautiously 90
replied: 103
`but 57
I 73
know 107
I 73
have 40
to 107
beat 102
time 141
when 114
I 73
learn 20
music.' 62
`Ah! 58
that 23
accounts 194
for 177
it,' 134
said 137
the 1
Hatter. 24
`He 189
won't 35
stand 198
beating. 42
Now, 102
if 157
you 39
only 180
kept 86
on 151
good 85
terms 175
with 134
him, 192
he'd 34
do 11
almost 10
anything 54
you 39
liked 181
with 134
the 1
clock. 176
For 25
instance, 127
suppose 137
it 171
were 25
nine 26
o'clock 126
in 165
the 1
morning, 96
just 164
time 141
to 107
begin 97
lessons: 135
you'd 188
only 180
have 40
to 107
whisper 90
a 97
hint 95
to 107
Time, 143
and 127
round 142
goes 190
the 1
clock 54
in 165
a 97
twinkling! 32
Half-past 172
one, 86
time 141
for 177
dinner!' 184
(`I 89
only 180
wish 103
it 171
was,' 44
the 1
March 171
Hare 4
said 137
to 107
itself 129
in 165
a 97
whisper.) 163
`That 127
would 85
be 139
grand, 168
certainly,' 38
said 137
Alice 168
thoughtfully: 71
`but 57
then--I 156
shouldn't 72
be 139
hungry 187
for 177
it, 145
you 39
know.' 4
`Not 51
at 123
first, 60
perhaps,' 36
said 137
the 1
Hatter: 12
`but 57
you 39
could 65
keep 141
it 171
to 107
half-past 196
one 182
as 122
long 12
as 122
you 39
liked.' 198
`Is 34
that 23
the 1
way 87
YOU 63
manage?' 5
Alice 168
asked. 90
The 49
Hatter 10
shook 198
his 114
head 32
mournfully. 5
`Not 51
I!' 15
he 125
replied. 115
`We 54
quarrelled 111
last 126
March--just 191
before 89
HE 101
went 116
mad, 180
you 39
know--' 92
(pointing 138
with 134
his 114
tea 104
spoon 129
at 123
the 1
March 171
Hare,) 47
`--it 27
was 81
at 123
the 1
great 21
concert 94
given 157
by 159
the 1
Queen 50
of 143
Hearts, 57
and 127
I 73
had 51
to 107
sing 183
"Twinkle, 82
twinkle, 152
little 2
bat! 164
How 152
I 73
wonder 141
what 196
you're 133
at!" 60
You 87
know 107
the 1
song, 63
perhaps?' 25
`I've 197
heard 126
something 182
like 151
it,' 134
said 137
Alice. 54
`It 35
goes 190
on, 125
you 39
know,' 66
the 1
Hatter 10
continued, 47
`in 21
this 70
way:-- 101
"Up 21
above 85
the 1
world 2
you 39
fly, 65
Like 39
a 97
tea-tray 53
in 165
the 1
sky. 189
Twinkle, 80
twinkle--"' 1
Here 48
the 1
Dormouse 182
shook 198
itself, 109
and 127
began 49
singing 67
in 165
its 16
sleep 47
`Twinkle, 128
twinkle, 152
twinkle, 152
twinkle--' 53
and 127
went 116
on 151
so 76
long 12
that 23
they 152
had 51
to 107
pinch 90
it 171
to 107
make 54
it 171
stop. 60
`Well, 2
I'd 62
hardly 112
finished 14
the 1
first 32
verse,' 32
said 137
the 1
Hatter, 26
`when 130
the 1
Queen 50
jumped 51
up 139
and 127
bawled 13
out, 78
"He's 51
murdering 21
the 1
time! 4
Off 183
with 134
his 114
head!"' 6
`How 88
dreadfully 192
savage!' 195
exclaimed 144
Alice. 54
`And 111
ever 134
since 50
that,' 190
the 1
Hatter 10
went 116
on 151
in 165
a 97
mournful 194
tone, 122
`he 181
won't 35
do 11
a 97
thing 118
I 73
ask! 192
It's 143
always 169
six 90
o'clock 126
now.' 135
A 65
bright 126
idea 183
came 6
into 72
Alice's 28
head. 38
`Is 34
that 23
the 1
reason 68
so 76
many 167
tea-things 22
are 52
put 175
out 14
here?' 144
she 40
asked. 90
`Yes, 85
that's 69
it,' 134
said 137
the 1
Hatter 10
with 134
a 97
sigh: 35
`it's 71
always 169
tea-time, 54
and 127
we've 128
no 121
time 141
to 107
wash 15
the 1
things 123
between 160
whiles.' 133
`Then 45
you 39
keep 141
moving 50
round, 50
I 73
suppose?' 25
said 137
Alice. 54
`Exactly 76
so,' 39
said 137
the 1
Hatter: 12
`as 178
the 1
things 123
get 30
used 93
up.' 44
`But 105
what 196
happens 89
when 114
you 39
come 60
to 107
the 1
beginning 115
again?' 112
Alice 168
ventured 31
to 107
ask. 5
`Suppose 41
we 190
change 32
the 1
subject,' 183
the 1
March 171
Hare 4
interrupted, 14
yawning. 45
`I'm 7
getting 108
tired 76
of 143
this. 16
I 73
vote 106
the 1
young 192
lady 66
tells 178
us 142
a 97
story.' 18
`I'm 7
afraid 161
I 73
don't 136
know 107
one,' 105
said 137
Alice, 52
rather 0
alarmed 160
at 123
the 1
proposal. 164
`Then 45
the 1
Dormouse 182
shall!' 130
they 152
both 89
cried. 91
`Wake 68
up, 153
Dormouse!' 28
And 175
they 152
pinched 183
it 171
on 151
both 89
sides 116
at 123
once. 157
The 49
Dormouse 182
slowly 34
opened 151
his 114
eyes. 4
`I 49
wasn't 190
asleep,' 79
he 125
said 137
in 165
a 97
hoarse, 74
feeble 155
voice: 64
`I 49
heard 126
every 75
word 34
you 39
fellows 28
were 25
saying.' 112
`Tell 177
us 142
a 97
story!' 21
said 137
the 1
March 171
Hare. 170
`Yes, 85
please 142
do!' 33
pleaded 45
Alice. 54
`And 111
be 139
quick 101
about 69
it,' 134
added 168
the 1
Hatter, 26
`or 11
you'll 112
be 139
asleep 2
again 192
before 89
it's 55
done.' 29
`Once 185
upon 130
a 97
time 141
there 196
were 25
three 86
little 2
sisters,' 150
the 1
Dormouse 182
began 49
in 165
a 97
great 21
hurry; 97
`and 63
their 130
names 32
were 25
Elsie, 132
Lacie, 94
and 127
Tillie; 122
and 127
they 152
lived 152
at 123
the 1
bottom 85
of 143
a 97
well--' 65
`What 100
did 55
they 152
live 92
on?' 103
said 137
Alice, 52
who 94
always 169
took 175
a 97
great 21
interest 2
in 165
questions 3
of 143
eating 134
and 127
drinking. 36
`They 56
lived 152
on 151
treacle,' 43
said 137
the 1
Dormouse, 74
after 140
thinking 80
a 97
minute 188
or 155
two. 2
`They 56
couldn't 118
have 40
done 82
that, 157
you 39
know,' 66
Alice 168
gently 167
remarked; 44
`they'd 59
have 40
been 20
ill.' 186
`So 140
they 152
were,' 68
said 137
the 1
Dormouse; 59
`VERY 182
ill.' 186
Alice 168
tried 146
to 107
fancy 169
to 107
herself 33
what 196
such 175
an 117
extraordinary 138
ways 12
of 143
living 127
would 85
be 139
like, 125
but 121
it 171
puzzled 82
her 189
too 28
much, 143
so 76
she 40
went 116
on: 139
`But 105
why 104
did 55
they 152
live 92
at 123
the 1
bottom 85
of 143
a 97
well?' 98
`Take 95
some 116
more 125
tea,' 147
the 1
March 171
Hare 4
said 137
to 107
Alice, 52
very 54
earnestly. 187
`I've 197
had 51
nothing 181
yet,' 11
Alice 168
replied 97
in 165
an 117
offended 21
tone, 122
`so 132
I 73
can't 141
take 191
more.' 106
`You 23
mean 197
you 39
can't 141
take 191
LESS,' 52
said 137
the 1
Hatter: 12
`it's 71
very 54
easy 194
to 107
take 191
MORE 37
than 17
nothing.' 110
`Nobody 75
asked 160
YOUR 35
opinion,' 45
said 137
Alice. 54
`Who's 14
making 45
personal 24
remarks 83
now?' 62
the 1
Hatter 10
asked 160
triumphantly. 179
Alice 168
did 55
not 67
quite 22
know 107
what 196
to 107
say 43
to 107
this: 28
so 76
she 40
helped 80
herself 33
to 107
some 116
tea 104
and 127
bread-and-butter, 153
and 127
then 141
turned 108
to 107
the 1
Dormouse, 74
and 127
repeated 190
her 189
question. 72
`Why 88
did 55
they 152
live 92
at 123
the 1
bottom 85
of 143
a 97
well?' 98
The 49
Dormouse 182
again 192
took 175
a 97
minute 188
or 155
two 76
to 107
think 122
about 69
it, 145
and 127
then 141
said, 91
`It 35
was 81
a 97
treacle-well.' 18
`There's 176
no 121
such 175
thing!' 140
Alice 168
was 81
beginning 115
very 54
angrily, 58
but 121
the 1
Hatter 10
and 127
the 1
March 171
Hare 4
went 116
`Sh! 156
sh!' 171
and 127
the 1
Dormouse 182
sulkily 139
remarked, 29
`If 21
you 39
can't 141
be 139
civil, 7
you'd 188
better 0
finish 5
the 1
story 197
for 177
yourself.' 88
`No, 179
please 142
go 104
on!' 173
Alice 168
said 137
very 54
humbly; 84
`I 49
won't 35
interrupt 75
again. 98
I 73
dare 152
say 43
there 196
may 77
be 139
ONE.' 31
`One, 190
indeed!' 123
said 137
the 1
Dormouse 182
indignantly. 101
However, 10
he 125
consented 31
to 107
go 104
on. 127
`And 111
so 76
these 27
three 86
little 2
sisters--they 161
were 25
learning 190
to 107
draw, 24
you 39
know--' 92
`What 100
did 55
they 152
draw?' 124
said 137
Alice, 52
quite 22
forgetting 141
her 189
promise. 69
`Treacle,' 29
said 137
the 1
Dormouse, 74
without 8
considering 121
at 123
all 73
this 70
time. 17
`I 49
want 72
a 97
clean 185
cup,' 161
interrupted 142
the 1
Hatter: 12
`let's 41
all 73
move 49
one 182
place 167
on.' 176
He 133
moved 19
on 151
as 122
he 125
spoke, 176
and 127
the 1
Dormouse 182
followed 88
him: 6
the 1
March 171
Hare 4
moved 19
into 72
the 1
Dormouse's 166
place, 75
and 127
Alice 168
rather 0
unwillingly 4
took 175
the 1
place 167
of 143
the 1
March 171
Hare. 170
The 49
Hatter 10
was 81
the 1
only 180
one 182
who 94
got 140
any 148
advantage 29
from 186
the 1
change: 26
and 127
Alice 168
was 81
a 97
good 85
deal 76
worse 20
off 135
than 17
before, 155
as 122
the 1
March 171
Hare 4
had 51
just 164
upset 111
the 1
milk-jug 166
into 72
his 114
plate. 136
Alice 168
did 55
not 67
wish 103
to 107
offend 140
the 1
Dormouse 182
again, 100
so 76
she 40
began 49
very 54
cautiously: 44
`But 105
I 73
don't 136
understand. 176
Where 87
did 55
they 152
draw 180
the 1
treacle 54
from?' 158
`You 23
can 56
draw 180
water 47
out 14
of 143
a 97
water-well,' 73
said 137
the 1
Hatter; 11
`so 132
I 73
should 61
think 122
you 39
could 65
draw 180
treacle 54
out 14
of 143
a 97
treacle-well--eh, 48
stupid?' 71
`But 105
they 152
were 25
IN 141
the 1
well,' 87
Alice 168
said 137
to 107
the 1
Dormouse, 74
not 67
choosing 12
to 107
notice 24
this 70
last 126
remark. 14
`Of 7
course 149
they 152
were', 18
said 137
the 1
Dormouse; 59
`--well 142
in.' 30
This 158
answer 170
so 76
confused 143
poor 18
Alice, 52
that 23
she 40
let 35
the 1
Dormouse 182
go 104
on 151
for 177
some 116
time 141
without 8
interrupting 1
it. 147
`They 56
were 25
learning 190
to 107
draw,' 113
the 1
Dormouse 182
went 116
on, 125
yawning 21
and 127
rubbing 191
its 16
eyes, 2
for 177
it 171
was 81
getting 108
very 54
sleepy; 23
`and 63
they 152
drew 104
all 73
manner 135
of 143
things--everything 192
that 23
begins 174
with 134
an 117
M--' 186
`Why 88
with 134
an 117
M?' 189
said 137
Alice. 54
`Why 88
not?' 179
said 137
the 1
March 171
Hare. 170
Alice 168
was 81
silent. 177
The 49
Dormouse 182
had 51
closed 132
its 16
eyes 18
by 159
this 70
time, 15
and 127
was 81
going 82
off 135
into 72
a 97
doze; 133
but, 195
on 151
being 167
pinched 183
by 159
the 1
Hatter, 26
it 171
woke 18
up 139
again 192
with 134
a 97
little 2
shriek, 186
and 127
went 116
on: 139
`--that 119
begins 174
with 134
an 117
M, 31
such 175
as 122
mouse-traps, 166
and 127
the 1
moon, 115
and 127
memory, 11
and 127
muchness-- 156
you 39
know 107
you 39
say 43
things 123
are 52
"much 143
of 143
a 97
muchness"--did 95
you 39
ever 134
see 147
such 175
a 97
thing 118
as 122
a 97
drawing 182
of 143
a 97
muchness?' 108
`Really, 71
now 70
you 39
ask 89
me,' 83
said 137
Alice, 52
very 54
much 29
confused, 5
`I 49
don't 136
think--' 141
`Then 45
you 39
shouldn't 72
talk,' 185
said 137
the 1
Hatter. 24
This 158
piece 38
of 143
rudeness 123
was 81
more 125
than 17
Alice 168
could 65
bear: 158
she 40
got 140
up 139
in 165
great 21
disgust, 87
and 127
walked 104
off; 44
the 1
Dormouse 182
fell 199
asleep 2
instantly, 142
and 127
neither 3
of 143
the 1
others 125
took 175
the 1
least 57
notice 24
of 143
her 189
going, 110
though 61
she 40
looked 98
back 111
once 81
or 155
twice, 12
half 131
hoping 151
that 23
they 152
would 85
call 182
after 140
her: 117
the 1
last 126
time 141
she 40
saw 41
them, 184
they 152
were 25
trying 57
to 107
put 175
the 1
Dormouse 182
into 72
the 1
teapot. 111
`At 187
any 148
rate 88
I'll 78
never 44
go 104
THERE 36
again!' 42
said 137
Alice 168
as 122
she 40
picked 112
her 189
way 87
through 171
the 1
wood. 17
`It's 159
the 1
stupidest 153
tea-party 119
I 73
ever 134
was 81
at 123
in 165
all 73
my 100
life!' 78
Just 52
as 122
she 40
said 137
this, 14
she 40
noticed 124
that 23
one 182
of 143
the 1
trees 117
had 51
a 97
door 126
leading 46
right 172
into 72
it. 147
`That's 51
very 54
curious!' 122
she 40
thought. 37
`But 105
everything's 73
curious 132
today. 35
I 73
think 122
I 73
may 77
as 122
well 46
go 104
in 165
at 123
once.' 190
And 175
in 165
she 40
went. 42
Once 169
more 125
she 40
found 90
herself 33
in 165
the 1
long 12
hall, 91
and 127
close 144
to 107
the 1
little 2
glass 188
table. 160
`Now, 118
I'll 78
manage 179
better 0
this 70
time,' 192
she 40
said 137
to 107
herself, 109
and 127
began 49
by 159
taking 188
the 1
little 2
golden 143
key, 93
and 127
unlocking 94
the 1
door 126
that 23
led 19
into 72
the 1
garden. 111
Then 29
she 40
went 116
to 107
work 41
nibbling 25
at 123
the 1
mushroom 112
(she 80
had 51
kept 86
a 97
piece 38
of 143
it 171
in 165
her 189
pocket) 157
till 117
she 40
was 81
about 69
a 97
foot 110
high: 104
then 141
she 40
walked 104
down 170
the 1
little 2
passage: 20
and 127
THEN--she 189
found 90
herself 33
at 123
last 126
in 165
the 1
beautiful 183
garden, 113
among 140
the 1
bright 126
flower-beds 148
and 127
the 1
cool 129
fountains. 89
CHAPTER 45
VIII 115
The 49
Queen's 154
Croquet-Ground 185
A 65
large 43
rose-tree 156
stood 83
near 192
the 1
entrance 178
of 143
the 1
garden: 99
the 1
roses 156
growing 23
on 151
it 171
were 25
white, 37
but 121
there 196
were 25
three 86
gardeners 161
at 123
it, 145
busily 2
painting 180
them 140
red. 181
Alice 168
thought 199
this 70
a 97
very 54
curious 132
thing, 194
and 127
she 40
went 116
nearer 139
to 107
watch 175
them, 184
and 127
just 164
as 122
she 40
came 6
up 139
to 107
them 140
she 40
heard 126
one 182
of 143
them 140
say, 177
`Look 151
out 14
now, 14
Five! 87
Don't 64
go 104
splashing 147
paint 110
over 44
me 80
like 151
that!' 131
`I 49
couldn't 118
help 185
it,' 134
said 137
Five, 98
in 165
a 97
sulky 88
tone; 137
`Seven 27
jogged 172
my 100
elbow.' 140
On 159
which 141
Seven 173
looked 98
up 139
and 127
said, 91
`That's 51
right, 120
Five! 87
Always 95
lay 116
the 1
blame 183
on 151
others!' 63
`YOU'D 180
better 0
not 67
talk!' 126
said 137
Five. 100
`I 49
heard 126
the 1
Queen 50
say 43
only 180
yesterday 174
you 39
deserved 118
to 107
be 139
beheaded!' 64
`What 100
for?' 89
said 137
the 1
one 182
who 94
had 51
spoken 110
first. 58
`That's 51
none 192
of 143
YOUR 35
business, 60
Two!' 26
said 137
Seven. 87
`Yes, 85
it 171
IS 146
his 114
business!' 102
said 137
Five, 98
`and 63
I'll 78
tell 73
him--it 167
was 81
for 177
bringing 176
the 1
cook 128
tulip-roots 146
instead 42
of 143
onions.' 43
Seven 173
flung 120
down 170
his 114
brush, 174
and 127
had 51
just 164
begun 69
`Well, 2
of 143
all 73
the 1
unjust 155
things--' 182
when 114
his 114
eye 113
chanced 24
to 107
fall 155
upon 130
Alice, 52
as 122
she 40
stood 83
watching 75
them, 184
and 127
he 125
checked 95
himself 32
suddenly: 58
the 1
others 125
looked 98
round 142
also, 165
and 127
all 73
of 143
them 140
bowed 49
low. 34
`Would 187
you 39
tell 73
me,' 83
said 137
Alice, 52
a 97
little 2
timidly, 108
`why 40
you 39
are 52
painting 180
those 37
roses?' 4
Five 34
and 127
Seven 173
said 137
nothing, 15
but 121
looked 98
at 123
Two. 90
Two 124
began 49
in 165
a 97
low 148
voice, 78
`Why 88
the 1
fact 84
is, 114
you 39
see, 1
Miss, 96
this 70
here 160
ought 101
to 107
have 40
been 20
a 97
RED 9
rose-tree, 152
and 127
we 190
put 175
a 97
white 65
one 182
in 165
by 159
mistake; 67
and 127
if 157
the 1
Queen 50
was 81
to 107
find 97
it 171
out, 78
we 190
should 61
all 73
have 40
our 12
heads 107
cut 82
off, 29
you 39
know. 163
So 84
you 39
see, 1
Miss, 96
we're 4
doing 119
our 12
best, 104
afore 125
she 40
comes, 27
to--' 116
At 131
this 70
moment 0
Five, 98
who 94
had 51
been 20
anxiously 92
looking 187
across 145
the 1
garden, 113
called 163
out 14
`The 185
Queen! 113
The 49
Queen!' 16
and 127
the 1
three 86
gardeners 161
instantly 158
threw 104
themselves 150
flat 193
upon 130
their 130
faces. 176
There 124
was 81
a 97
sound 63
of 143
many 167
footsteps, 83
and 127
Alice 168
looked 98
round, 50
eager 176
to 107
see 147
the 1
Queen. 100
First 160
came 6
ten 117
soldiers 169
carrying 103
clubs; 130
these 27
were 25
all 73
shaped 157
like 151
the 1
three 86
gardeners, 67
oblong 65
and 127
flat, 27
with 134
their 130
hands 36
and 127
feet 190
at 123
the 1
corners: 196
next 107
the 1
ten 117
courtiers; 85
these 27
were 25
ornamented 115
all 73
over 44
with 134
diamonds, 125
and 127
walked 104
two 76
and 127
two, 0
as 122
the 1
soldiers 169
did. 151
After 68
these 27
came 6
the 1
royal 191
children; 188
there 196
were 25
ten 117
of 143
them, 184
and 127
the 1
little 2
dears 57
came 6
jumping 156
merrily 14
along 149
hand 191
in 165
hand, 165
in 165
couples: 57
they 152
were 25
all 73
ornamented 115
with 134
hearts. 161
Next 195
came 6
the 1
guests, 169
mostly 96
Kings 148
and 127
Queens, 69
and 127
among 140
them 140
Alice 168
recognised 151
the 1
White 193
Rabbit: 104
it 171
was 81
talking 34
in 165
a 97
hurried 83
nervous 98
manner, 27
smiling 75
at 123
everything 163
that 23
was 81
said, 91
and 127
went 116
by 159
without 8
noticing 61
her. 105
Then 29
followed 88
the 1
Knave 61
of 143
Hearts, 57
carrying 103
the 1
King's 149
crown 23
on 151
a 97
crimson 7
velvet 184
cushion; 146
and, 181
last 126
of 143
all 73
this 70
grand 164
procession, 187
came 6
THE 25
KING 167
AND 151
QUEEN 162
OF 119
HEARTS. 81
Alice 168
was 81
rather 0
doubtful 185
whether 109
she 40
ought 101
not 67
to 107
lie 144
down 170
on 151
her 189
face 69
like 151
the 1
three 86
gardeners, 67
but 121
she 40
could 65
not 67
remember 35
ever 134
having 99
heard 126
of 143
such 175
a 97
rule 60
at 123
processions; 161
`and 63
besides, 195
what 196
would 85
be 139
the 1
use 103
of 143
a 97
procession,' 140
thought 199
she, 84
`if 13
people 81
had 51
all 73
to 107
lie 144
down 170
upon 130
their 130
faces, 178
so 76
that 23
they 152
couldn't 118
see 147
it?' 123
So 84
she 40
stood 83
still 32
where 159
she 40
was, 155
and 127
waited. 154
When 2
the 1
procession 1
came 6
opposite 57
to 107
Alice, 52
they 152
all 73
stopped 83
and 127
looked 98
at 123
her, 103
and 127
the 1
Queen 50
said 137
severely 121
`Who 78
is 170
this?' 34
She 88
said 137
it 171
to 107
the 1
Knave 61
of 143
Hearts, 57
who 94
only 180
bowed 49
and 127
smiled 68
in 165
reply. 84
`Idiot!' 63
said 137
the 1
Queen, 102
tossing 145
her 189
head 32
impatiently; 197
and, 181
turning 115
to 107
Alice, 52
she 40
went 116
on, 125
`What's 104
your 123
name, 161
child?' 132
`My 164
name 107
is 170
Alice, 52
so 76
please 142
your 123
Majesty,' 44
said 137
Alice 168
very 54
politely; 159
but 121
she 40
added, 44
to 107
herself, 109
`Why, 172
they're 54
only 180
a 97
pack 185
of 143
cards, 127
after 140
all. 109
I 73
needn't 109
be 139
afraid 161
of 143
them!' 94
`And 111
who 94
are 52
THESE?' 149
said 137
the 1
Queen, 102
pointing 26
to 107
the 1
three 86
gardeners 161
who 94
were 25
lying 197
round 142
the 1
rosetree; 82
for, 131
you 39
see, 1
as 122
they 152
were 25
lying 197
on 151
their 130
faces, 178
and 127
the 1
pattern 88
on 151
their 130
backs 156
was 81
the 1
same 62
as 122
the 1
rest 116
of 143
the 1
pack, 179
she 40
could 65
not 67
tell 73
whether 109
they 152
were 25
gardeners, 67
or 155
soldiers, 173
or 155
courtiers, 100
or 155
three 86
of 143
her 189
own 70
children. 1
`How 88
should 61
I 73
know?' 77
said 137
Alice, 52
surprised 83
at 123
her 189
own 70
courage. 40
`It's 159
no 121
business 112
of 143
MINE.' 164
The 49
Queen 50
turned 108
crimson 7
with 134
fury, 38
and, 181
after 140
glaring 68
at 123
her 189
for 177
a 97
moment 0
like 151
a 97
wild 82
beast, 195
screamed 42
`Off 119
with 134
her 189
head! 25
Off--' 64
`Nonsense!' 17
said 137
Alice, 52
very 54
loudly 41
and 127
decidedly, 171
and 127
the 1
Queen 50
was 81
silent. 177
The 49
King 143
laid 0
his 114
hand 191
upon 130
her 189
arm, 104
and 127
timidly 136
said 137
`Consider, 53
my 100
dear: 0
she 40
is 170
only 180
a 97
child!' 2
The 49
Queen 50
turned 108
angrily 138
away 14
from 186
him, 192
and 127
said 137
to 107
the 1
Knave 61
`Turn 141
them 140
over!' 150
The 49
Knave 61
did 55
so, 0
very 54
carefully, 123
with 134
one 182
foot. 56
`Get 14
up!' 41
said 137
the 1
Queen, 102
in 165
a 97
shrill, 144
loud 26
voice, 78
and 127
the 1
three 86
gardeners 161
instantly 158
jumped 51
up, 153
and 127
began 49
bowing 120
to 107
the 1
King, 77
the 1
Queen, 102
the 1
royal 191
children, 3
and 127
everybody 21
else. 141
`Leave 137
off 135
that!' 131
screamed 42
the 1
Queen. 100
`You 23
make 54
me 80
giddy.' 32
And 175
then, 15
turning 115
to 107
the 1
rose-tree, 152
she 40
went 116
on, 125
`What 100
HAVE 152
you 39
been 20
doing 119
here?' 144
`May 61
it 171
please 142
your 123
Majesty,' 44
said 137
Two, 88
in 165
a 97
very 54
humble 189
tone, 122
going 82
down 170
on 151
one 182
knee 179
as 122
he 125
spoke, 176
`we 46
were 25
trying--' 192
`I 49
see!' 129
said 137
the 1
Queen, 102
who 94
had 51
meanwhile 84
been 20
examining 106
the 1
roses. 14
`Off 119
with 134
their 130
heads!' 177
and 127
the 1
procession 1
moved 19
on, 125
three 86
of 143
the 1
soldiers 169
remaining 126
behind 198
to 107
execute 147
the 1
unfortunate 125
gardeners, 67
who 94
ran 71
to 107
Alice 168
for 177
protection. 83
`You 23
shan't 185
be 139
beheaded!' 64
said 137
Alice, 52
and 127
she 40
put 175
them 140
into 72
a 97
large 43
flower-pot 19
that 23
stood 83
near. 198
The 49
three 86
soldiers 169
wandered 84
about 69
for 177
a 97
minute 188
or 155
two, 0
looking 187
for 177
them, 184
and 127
then 141
quietly 57
marched 146
off 135
after 140
the 1
others. 157
`Are 36
their 130
heads 107
off?' 127
shouted 0
the 1
Queen. 100
`Their 142
heads 107
are 52
gone, 149
if 157
it 171
please 142
your 123
Majesty!' 185
the 1
soldiers 169
shouted 0
in 165
reply. 84
`That's 51
right!' 50
shouted 0
the 1
Queen. 100
`Can 40
you 39
play 108
croquet?' 35
The 49
soldiers 169
were 25
silent, 175
and 127
looked 98
at 123
Alice, 52
as 122
the 1
question 106
was 81
evidently 140
meant 23
for 177
her. 105
`Yes!' 163
shouted 0
Alice. 54
`Come 164
on, 125
then!' 133
roared 139
the 1
Queen, 102
and 127
Alice 168
joined 63
the 1
procession, 187
wondering 183
very 54
much 29
what 196
would 85
happen 190
next. 163
`It's--it's 170
a 97
very 54
fine 98
day!' 170
said 137
a 97
timid 195
voice 154
at 123
her 189
side. 47
She 88
was 81
walking 9
by 159
the 1
White 193
Rabbit, 118
who 94
was 81
peeping 150
anxiously 92
into 72
her 189
face. 185
`Very,' 121
said 137
Alice: 66
`--where's 163
the 1
Duchess?' 87
`Hush! 169
Hush!' 96
said 137
the 1
Rabbit 110
in 165
a 97
low, 32
hurried 83
tone. 124
He 133
looked 98
anxiously 92
over 44
his 114
shoulder 184
as 122
he 125
spoke, 176
and 127
then 141
raised 144
himself 32
upon 130
tiptoe, 195
put 175
his 114
mouth 127
close 144
to 107
her 189
ear, 86
and 127
whispered 199
`She's 108
under 112
sentence 195
of 143
execution.' 183
`What 100
for?' 89
said 137
Alice. 54
`Did 39
you 39
say 43
"What 198
a 97
pity!"?' 177
the 1
Rabbit 110
asked. 90
`No, 179
I 73
didn't,' 105
said 137
Alice: 66
`I 49
don't 136
think 122
it's 55
at 123
all 73
a 97
pity. 80
I 73
said 137
"What 198
for?"' 53
`She 24
boxed 10
the 1
Queen's 154
ears--' 46
the 1
Rabbit 110
began. 131
Alice 168
gave 49
a 97
little 2
scream 1
of 143
laughter. 122
`Oh, 123
hush!' 64
the 1
Rabbit 110
whispered 199
in 165
a 97
frightened 154
tone. 124
`The 185
Queen 50
will 90
hear 46
you! 42
You 87
see, 1
she 40
came 6
rather 0
late, 46
and 127
the 1
Queen 50
said--' 142
`Get 14
to 107
your 123
places!' 34
shouted 0
the 1
Queen 50
in 165
a 97
voice 154
of 143
thunder, 176
and 127
people 81
began 49
running 135
about 69
in 165
all 73
directions, 40
tumbling 12
up 139
against 23
each 81
other; 181
however, 138
they 152
got 140
settled 73
down 170
in 165
a 97
minute 188
or 155
two, 0
and 127
the 1
game 170
began. 131
Alice 168
thought 199
she 40
had 51
never 44
seen 67
such 175
a 97
curious 132
croquet-ground 95
in 165
her 189
life; 135
it 171
was 81
all 73
ridges 48
and 127
furrows; 103
the 1
balls 36
were 25
live 92
hedgehogs, 148
the 1
mallets 136
live 92
flamingoes, 7
and 127
the 1
soldiers 169
had 51
to 107
double 191
themselves 150
up 139
and 127
to 107
stand 198
on 151
their 130
hands 36
and 127
feet, 134
to 107
make 54
the 1
arches. 30
The 49
chief 181
difficulty 59
Alice 168
found 90
at 123
first 32
was 81
in 165
managing 170
her 189
flamingo: 45
she 40
succeeded 41
in 165
getting 108
its 16
body 10
tucked 56
away, 78
comfortably 86
enough, 92
under 112
her 189
arm, 104
with 134
its 16
legs 197
hanging 160
down, 114
but 121
generally, 191
just 164
as 122
she 40
had 51
got 140
its 16
neck 47
nicely 142
straightened 42
out, 78
and 127
was 81
going 82
to 107
give 137
the 1
hedgehog 181
a 97
blow 66
with 134
its 16
head, 36
it 171
WOULD 125
twist 151
itself 129
round 142
and 127
look 47
up 139
in 165
her 189
face, 183
with 134
such 175
a 97
puzzled 82
expression 64
that 23
she 40
could 65
not 67
help 185
bursting 30
out 14
laughing: 103
and 127
when 114
she 40
had 51
got 140
its 16
head 32
down, 114
and 127
was 81
going 82
to 107
begin 97
again, 100
it 171
was 81
very 54
provoking 179
to 107
find 97
that 23
the 1
hedgehog 181
had 51
unrolled 19
itself, 109
and 127
was 81
in 165
the 1
act 2
of 143
crawling 147
away: 92
besides 111
all 73
this, 14
there 196
was 81
generally 69
a 97
ridge 43
or 155
furrow 49
in 165
the 1
way 87
wherever 148
she 40
wanted 73
to 107
send 136
the 1
hedgehog 181
to, 161
and, 181
as 122
the 1
doubled-up 21
soldiers 169
were 25
always 169
getting 108
up 139
and 127
walking 9
off 135
to 107
other 176
parts 144
of 143
the 1
ground, 77
Alice 168
soon 187
came 6
to 107
the 1
conclusion 73
that 23
it 171
was 81
a 97
very 54
difficult 142
game 170
indeed. 1
The 49
players 166
all 73
played 77
at 123
once 81
without 8
waiting 165
for 177
turns, 130
quarrelling 34
all 73
the 1
while, 125
and 127
fighting 158
for 177
the 1
hedgehogs; 163
and 127
in 165
a 97
very 54
short 100
time 141
the 1
Queen 50
was 81
in 165
a 97
furious 121
passion, 101
and 127
went 116
stamping 151
about, 113
and 127
shouting 183
`Off 119
with 134
his 114
head!' 82
or 155
`Off 119
with 134
her 189
head!' 82
about 69
once 81
in 165
a 97
minute. 186
Alice 168
began 49
to 107
feel 182
very 54
uneasy: 41
to 107
be 139
sure, 191
she 40
had 51
not 67
as 122
yet 128
had 51
any 148
dispute 180
with 134
the 1
Queen, 102
but 121
she 40
knew 197
that 23
it 171
might 167
happen 190
any 148
minute, 184
`and 63
then,' 192
thought 199
she, 84
`what 12
would 85
become 17
of 143
me? 143
They're 26
dreadfully 192
fond 63
of 143
beheading 121
people 81
here; 19
the 1
great 21
wonder 141
is, 114
that 23
there's 120
any 148
one 182
left 167
alive!' 85
She 88
was 81
looking 187
about 69
for 177
some 116
way 87
of 143
escape, 53
and 127
wondering 183
whether 109
she 40
could 65
get 30
away 14
without 8
being 167
seen, 121
when 114
she 40
noticed 124
a 97
curious 132
appearance 68
in 165
the 1
air: 24
it 171
puzzled 82
her 189
very 54
much 29
at 123
first, 60
but, 195
after 140
watching 75
it 171
a 97
minute 188
or 155
two, 0
she 40
made 37
it 171
out 14
to 107
be 139
a 97
grin, 196
and 127
she 40
said 137
to 107
herself 33
`It's 159
the 1
Cheshire 135
Cat: 68
now 70
I 73
shall 52
have 40
somebody 86
to 107
talk 28
to.' 92
`How 88
are 52
you 39
getting 108
on?' 103
said 137
the 1
Cat, 54
as 122
soon 187
as 122
there 196
was 81
mouth 127
enough 0
for 177
it 171
to 107
speak 82
with. 0
Alice 168
waited 28
till 117
the 1
eyes 18
appeared, 160
and 127
then 141
nodded. 70
`It's 159
no 121
use 103
speaking 176
to 107
it,' 134
she 40
thought, 35
`till 133
its 16
ears 157
have 40
come, 104
or 155
at 123
least 57
one 182
of 143
them.' 91
In 173
another 173
minute 188
the 1
whole 183
head 32
appeared, 160
and 127
then 141
Alice 168
put 175
down 170
her 189
flamingo, 59
and 127
began 49
an 117
account 67
of 143
the 1
game, 114
feeling 132
very 54
glad 168
she 40
had 51
someone 62
to 107
listen 1
to 107
her. 105
The 49
Cat 110
seemed 39
to 107
think 122
that 23
there 196
was 81
enough 0
of 143
it 171
now 70
in 165
sight, 169
and 127
no 121
more 125
of 143
it 171
appeared. 162
`I 49
don't 136
think 122
they 152
play 108
at 123
all 73
fairly,' 36
Alice 168
began, 133
in 165
rather 0
a 97
complaining 89
tone, 122
`and 63
they 152
all 73
quarrel 20
so 76
dreadfully 192
one 182
can't 141
hear 46
oneself 6
speak--and 21
they 152
don't 136
seem 66
to 107
have 40
any 148
rules 175
in 165
particular; 14
at 123
least, 85
if 157
there 196
are, 56
nobody 45
attends 191
to 107
them--and 101
you've 9
no 121
idea 183
how 104
confusing 192
it 171
is 170
all 73
the 1
things 123
being 167
alive; 138
for 177
instance, 127
there's 120
the 1
arch 54
I've 181
got 140
to 107
go 104
through 171
next 107
walking 9
about 69
at 123
the 1
other 176
end 171
of 143
the 1
ground--and 64
I 73
should 61
have 40
croqueted 74
the 1
Queen's 154
hedgehog 181
just 164
now, 14
only 180
it 171
ran 71
away 14
when 114
it 171
saw 41
mine 35
coming!' 169
`How 88
do 11
you 39
like 151
the 1
Queen?' 86
said 137
the 1
Cat 110
in 165
a 97
low 148
voice. 76
`Not 51
at 123
all,' 156
said 137
Alice: 66
`she's 36
so 76
extremely--' 194
Just 52
then 141
she 40
noticed 124
that 23
the 1
Queen 50
was 81
close 144
behind 198
her, 103
listening: 31
so 76
she 40
went 116
on, 125
`--likely 196
to 107
win, 88
that 23
it's 55
hardly 112
worth 54
while 17
finishing 103
the 1
game.' 61
The 49
Queen 50
smiled 68
and 127
passed 136
on. 127
`Who 78
ARE 76
you 39
talking 34
to?' 19
said 137
the 1
King, 77
going 82
up 139
to 107
Alice, 52
and 127
looking 187
at 123
the 1
Cat's 34
head 32
with 134
great 21
curiosity. 107
`It's 159
a 97
friend 74
of 143
mine--a 14
Cheshire 135
Cat,' 113
said 137
Alice: 66
`allow 87
me 80
to 107
introduce 183
it.' 196
`I 49
don't 136
like 151
the 1
look 47
of 143
it 171
at 123
all,' 156
said 137
the 1
King: 91
`however, 146
it 171
may 77
kiss 22
my 100
hand 191
if 157
it 171
likes.' 13
`I'd 198
rather 0
not,' 190
the 1
Cat 110
remarked. 31
`Don't 136
be 139
impertinent,' 190
said 137
the 1
King, 77
`and 63
don't 136
look 47
at 123
me 80
like 151
that!' 131
He 133
got 140
behind 198
Alice 168
as 122
he 125
spoke. 174
`A 41
cat 62
may 77
look 47
at 123
a 97
king,' 38
said 137
Alice. 54
`I've 197
read 142
that 23
in 165
some 116
book, 91
but 121
I 73
don't 136
remember 35
where.' 64
`Well, 2
it 171
must 137
be 139
removed,' 179
said 137
the 1
King 143
very 54
decidedly, 171
and 127
he 125
called 163
the 1
Queen, 102
who 94
was 81
passing 87
at 123
the 1
moment, 12
`My 164
dear! 175
I 73
wish 103
you 39
would 85
have 40
this 70
cat 62
removed!' 38
The 49
Queen 50
had 51
only 180
one 182
way 87
of 143
settling 176
all 73
difficulties, 157
great 21
or 155
small. 33
`Off 119
with 134
his 114
head!' 82
she 40
said, 91
without 8
even 130
looking 187
round. 48
`I'll 94
fetch 82
the 1
executioner 3
myself,' 35
said 137
the 1
King 143
eagerly, 129
and 127
he 125
hurried 83
off. 31
Alice 168
thought 199
she 40
might 167
as 122
well 46
go 104
back, 85
and 127
see 147
how 104
the 1
game 170
was 81
going 82
on, 125
as 122
she 40
heard 126
the 1
Queen's 154
voice 154
in 165
the 1
distance, 167
screaming 43
with 134
passion. 103
She 88
had 51
already 128
heard 126
her 189
sentence 195
three 86
of 143
the 1
players 166
to 107
be 139
executed 103
for 177
having 99
missed 21
their 130
turns, 130
and 127
she 40
did 55
not 67
like 151
the 1
look 47
of 143
things 123
at 123
all, 107
as 122
the 1
game 170
was 81
in 165
such 175
confusion 154
that 23
she 40
never 44
knew 197
whether 109
it 171
was 81
her 189
turn 37
or 155
not. 123
So 84
she 40
went 116
in 165
search 56
of 143
her 189
hedgehog. 93
The 49
hedgehog 181
was 81
engaged 117
in 165
a 97
fight 120
with 134
another 173
hedgehog, 95
which 141
seemed 39
to 107
Alice 168
an 117
excellent 198
opportunity 157
for 177
croqueting 9
one 182
of 143
them 140
with 134
the 1
other: 182
the 1
only 180
difficulty 59
was, 155
that 23
her 189
flamingo 79
was 81
gone 55
across 145
to 107
the 1
other 176
side 71
of 143
the 1
garden, 113
where 159
Alice 168
could 65
see 147
it 171
trying 57
in 165
a 97
helpless 94
sort 86
of 143
way 87
to 107
fly 91
up 139
into 72
a 97
tree. 48
By 167
the 1
time 141
she 40
had 51
caught 140
the 1
flamingo 79
and 127
brought 37
it 171
back, 85
the 1
fight 120
was 81
over, 8
and 127
both 89
the 1
hedgehogs 24
were 25
out 14
of 143
sight: 155
`but 57
it 171
doesn't 66
matter 23
much,' 24
thought 199
Alice, 52
`as 178
all 73
the 1
arches 156
are 52
gone 55
from 186
this 70
side 71
of 143
the 1
ground.' 96
So 84
she 40
tucked 56
it 171
away 14
under 112
her 189
arm, 104
that 23
it 171
might 167
not 67
escape 31
again, 100
and 127
went 116
back 111
for 177
a 97
little 2
more 125
conversation 99
with 134
her 189
friend. 184
When 2
she 40
got 140
back 111
to 107
the 1
Cheshire 135
Cat, 54
she 40
was 81
surprised 83
to 107
find 97
quite 22
a 97
large 43
crowd 13
collected 145
round 142
it: 159
there 196
was 81
a 97
dispute 180
going 82
on 151
between 160
the 1
executioner, 161
the 1
King, 77
and 127
the 1
Queen, 102
who 94
were 25
all 73
talking 34
at 123
once, 155
while 17
all 73
the 1
rest 116
were 25
quite 22
silent, 175
and 127
looked 98
very 54
uncomfortable. 151
The 49
moment 0
Alice 168
appeared, 160
she 40
was 81
appealed 198
to 107
by 159
all 73
three 86
to 107
settle 29
the 1
question, 74
and 127
they 152
repeated 190
their 130
arguments 98
to 107
her, 103
though, 71
as 122
they 152
all 73
spoke 196
at 123
once, 155
she 40
found 90
it 171
very 54
hard 115
indeed 139
to 107
make 54
out 14
exactly 20
what 196
they 152
said. 93
The 49
executioner's 33
argument 99
was, 155
that 23
you 39
couldn't 118
cut 82
off 135
a 97
head 32
unless 150
there 196
was 81
a 97
body 10
to 107
cut 82
it 171
off 135
from: 24
that 23
he 125
had 51
never 44
had 51
to 107
do 11
such 175
a 97
thing 118
before, 155
and 127
he 125
wasn't 190
going 82
to 107
begin 97
at 123
HIS 138
time 141
of 143
life. 122
The 49
King's 149
argument 99
was, 155
that 23
anything 54
that 23
had 51
a 97
head 32
could 65
be 139
beheaded, 134
and 127
that 23
you 39
weren't 10
to 107
talk 28
nonsense. 141
The 49
Queen's 154
argument 99
was, 155
that 23
if 157
something 182
wasn't 190
done 82
about 69
it 171
in 165
less 169
than 17
no 121
time 141
she'd 149
have 40
everybody 21
executed, 3
all 73
round. 48
(It 19
was 81
this 70
last 126
remark 184
that 23
had 51
made 37
the 1
whole 183
party 150
look 47
so 76
grave 13
and 127
anxious.) 90
Alice 168
could 65
think 122
of 143
nothing 181
else 145
to 107
say 43
but 121
`It 35
belongs 140
to 107
the 1
Duchess: 27
you'd 188
better 0
ask 89
HER 13
about 69
it.' 196
`She's 108
in 165
prison,' 82
the 1
Queen 50
said 137
to 107
the 1
executioner: 147
`fetch 118
her 189
here.' 71
And 175
the 1
executioner 3
went 116
off 135
like 151
an 117
arrow. 75
The 49
Cat's 34
head 32
began 49
fading 39
away 14
the 1
moment 0
he 125
was 81
gone, 149
and, 181
by 159
the 1
time 141
he 125
had 51
come 60
back 111
with 134
the 1
Duchess, 13
it 171
had 51
entirely 170
disappeared; 121
so 76
the 1
King 143
and 127
the 1
executioner 3
ran 71
wildly 25
up 139
and 127
down 170
looking 187
for 177
it, 145
while 17
the 1
rest 116
of 143
the 1
party 150
went 116
back 111
to 107
the 1
game. 116
CHAPTER 45
IX 151
The 49
Mock 154
Turtle's 16
Story 125
`You 23
can't 141
think 122
how 104
glad 168
I 73
am 116
to 107
see 147
you 39
again, 100
you 39
dear 82
old 119
thing!' 140
said 137
the 1
Duchess, 13
as 122
she 40
tucked 56
her 189
arm 60
affectionately 156
into 72
Alice's, 32
and 127
they 152
walked 104
off 135
together. 84
Alice 168
was 81
very 54
glad 168
to 107
find 97
her 189
in 165
such 175
a 97
pleasant 36
temper, 133
and 127
thought 199
to 107
herself 33
that 23
perhaps 119
it 171
was 81
only 180
the 1
pepper 94
that 23
had 51
made 37
her 189
so 76
savage 145
when 114
they 152
met 196
in 165
the 1
kitchen. 110
`When 18
I'M 39
a 97
Duchess,' 98
she 40
said 137
to 107
herself, 109
(not 107
in 165
a 97
very 54
hopeful 73
tone 138
though), 110
`I 49
won't 35
have 40
any 148
pepper 94
in 165
my 100
kitchen 156
AT 99
ALL. 53
Soup 63
does 17
very 54
well 46
without--Maybe 160
it's 55
always 169
pepper 94
that 23
makes 189
people 81
hot-tempered,' 195
she 40
went 116
on, 125
very 54
much 29
pleased 30
at 123
having 99
found 90
out 14
a 97
new 160
kind 52
of 143
rule, 104
`and 63
vinegar 118
that 23
makes 189
them 140
sour--and 114
camomile 171
that 23
makes 189
them 140
bitter--and--and 4
barley-sugar 174
and 127
such 175
things 123
that 23
make 54
children 55
sweet-tempered. 121
I 73
only 180
wish 103
people 81
knew 197
that: 171
then 141
they 152
wouldn't 14
be 139
so 76
stingy 16
about 69
it, 145
you 39
know--' 92
She 88
had 51
quite 22
forgotten 154
the 1
Duchess 81
by 159
this 70
time, 15
and 127
was 81
a 97
little 2
startled 121
when 114
she 40
heard 126
her 189
voice 154
close 144
to 107
her 189
ear. 88
`You're 187
thinking 80
about 69
something, 14
my 100
dear, 186
and 127
that 23
makes 189
you 39
forget 59
to 107
talk. 114
I 73
can't 141
tell 73
you 39
just 164
now 70
what 196
the 1
moral 59
of 143
that 23
is, 114
but 121
I 73
shall 52
remember 35
it 171
in 165
a 97
bit.' 54
`Perhaps 177
it 171
hasn't 55
one,' 105
Alice 168
ventured 31
to 107
remark. 14
`Tut, 137
tut, 33
child!' 2
said 137
the 1
Duchess. 15
`Everything's 15
got 140
a 97
moral, 23
if 157
only 180
you 39
can 56
find 97
it.' 196
And 175
she 40
squeezed 86
herself 33
up 139
closer 118
to 107
Alice's 28
side 71
as 122
she 40
spoke. 174
Alice 168
did 55
not 67
much 29
like 151
keeping 59
so 76
close 144
to 107
her: 117
first, 60
because 18
the 1
Duchess 81
was 81
VERY 166
ugly; 28
and 127
secondly, 181
because 18
she 40
was 81
exactly 20
the 1
right 172
height 193
to 107
rest 116
her 189
chin 18
upon 130
Alice's 28
shoulder, 68
and 127
it 171
was 81
an 117
uncomfortably 65
sharp 42
chin. 4
However, 10
she 40
did 55
not 67
like 151
to 107
be 139
rude, 16
so 76
she 40
bore 24
it 171
as 122
well 46
as 122
she 40
could. 35
`The 185
game's 2
going 82
on 151
rather 0
better 0
now,' 73
she 40
said, 91
by 159
way 87
of 143
keeping 59
up 139
the 1
conversation 99
a 97
little. 152
`'Tis 159
so,' 39
said 137
the 1
Duchess: 27
`and 63
the 1
moral 59
of 143
that 23
is--"Oh, 21
'tis 95
love, 42
'tis 95
love, 42
that 23
makes 189
the 1
world 2
go 104
round!"' 56
`Somebody 194
said,' 36
Alice 168
whispered, 173
`that 39
it's 55
done 82
by 159
everybody 21
minding 104
their 130
own 70
business!' 102
`Ah, 69
well! 59
It 179
means 22
much 29
the 1
same 62
thing,' 199
said 137
the 1
Duchess, 13
digging 93
her 189
sharp 42
little 2
chin 18
into 72
Alice's 28
shoulder 184
as 122
she 40
added, 44
`and 63
the 1
moral 59
of 143
THAT 135
is--"Take 191
care 161
of 143
the 1
sense, 10
and 127
the 1
sounds 28
will 90
take 191
care 161
of 143
themselves."' 43
`How 88
fond 63
she 40
is 170
of 143
finding 167
morals 152
in 165
things!' 75
Alice 168
thought 199
to 107
herself. 107
`I 49
dare 152
say 43
you're 133
wondering 183
why 104
I 73
don't 136
put 175
my 100
arm 60
round 142
your 123
waist,' 35
the 1
Duchess 81
said 137
after 140
a 97
pause: 196
`the 137
reason 68
is, 114
that 23
I'm 71
doubtful 185
about 69
the 1
temper 63
of 143
your 123
flamingo. 57
Shall 180
I 73
try 131
the 1
experiment?' 35
`HE 157
might 167
bite,' 173
Alice 168
cautiously 90
replied, 117
not 67
feeling 132
at 123
all 73
anxious 161
to 107
have 40
the 1
experiment 91
tried. 124
`Very 158
true,' 175
said 137
the 1
Duchess: 27
`flamingoes 189
and 127
mustard 10
both 89
bite. 166
And 175
the 1
moral 59
of 143
that 23
is--"Birds 6
of 143
a 97
feather 117
flock 17
together."' 183
`Only 84
mustard 10
isn't 105
a 97
bird,' 116
Alice 168
remarked. 31
`Right, 0
as 122
usual,' 83
said 137
the 1
Duchess: 27
`what 12
a 97
clear 189
way 87
you 39
have 40
of 143
putting 155
things!' 75
`It's 159
a 97
mineral, 198
I 73
THINK,' 43
said 137
Alice. 54
`Of 7
course 149
it 171
is,' 173
said 137
the 1
Duchess, 13
who 94
seemed 39
ready 123
to 107
agree 196
to 107
everything 163
that 23
Alice 168
said; 106
`there's 104
a 97
large 43
mustard-mine 50
near 192
here. 6
And 175
the 1
moral 59
of 143
that 23
is--"The 159
more 125
there 196
is 170
of 143
mine, 129
the 1
less 169
there 196
is 170
of 143
yours."' 157
`Oh, 123
I 73
know!' 7
exclaimed 144
Alice, 52
who 94
had 51
not 67
attended 25
to 107
this 70
last 126
remark, 12
`it's 71
a 97
vegetable. 67
It 179
doesn't 66
look 47
like 151
one, 86
but 121
it 171
is.' 35
`I 49
quite 22
agree 196
with 134
you,' 82
said 137
the 1
Duchess; 28
`and 63
the 1
moral 59
of 143
that 23
is--"Be 19
what 196
you 39
would 85
seem 66
to 107
be"--or 118
if 157
you'd 188
like 151
it 171
put 175
more 125
simply--"Never 152
imagine 78
yourself 145
not 67
to 107
be 139
otherwise 172
than 17
what 196
it 171
might 167
appear 123
to 107
others 125
that 23
what 196
you 39
were 25
or 155
might 167
have 40
been 20
was 81
not 67
otherwise 172
than 17
what 196
you 39
had 51
been 20
would 85
have 40
appeared 164
to 107
them 140
to 107
be 139
otherwise."' 87
`I 49
think 122
I 73
should 61
understand 178
that 23
better,' 155
Alice 168
said 137
very 54
politely, 174
`if 13
I 73
had 51
it 171
written 31
down: 128
but 121
I 73
can't 141
quite 22
follow 87
it 171
as 122
you 39
say 43
it.' 196
`That's 51
nothing 181
to 107
what 196
I 73
could 65
say 43
if 157
I 73
chose,' 167
the 1
Duchess 81
replied, 117
in 165
a 97
pleased 30
tone. 124
`Pray 178
don't 136
trouble 185
yourself 145
to 107
say 43
it 171
any 148
longer 119
than 17
that,' 190
said 137
Alice. 54
`Oh, 123
don't 136
talk 28
about 69
trouble!' 133
said 137
the 1
Duchess. 15
`I 49
make 54
you 39
a 97
present 45
of 143
everything 163
I've 181
said 137
as 122
yet.' 73
`A 41
cheap 23
sort 86
of 143
present!' 167
thought 199
Alice. 54
`I'm 7
glad 168
they 152
don't 136
give 137
birthday 125
presents 88
like 151
that!' 131
But 169
she 40
did 55
not 67
venture 147
to 107
say 43
it 171
out 14
loud. 52
`Thinking 0
again?' 112
the 1
Duchess 81
asked, 92
with 134
another 173
dig 58
of 143
her 189
sharp 42
little 2
chin. 4
`I've 197
a 97
right 172
to 107
think,' 155
said 137
Alice 168
sharply, 59
for 177
she 40
was 81
beginning 115
to 107
feel 182
a 97
little 2
worried. 14
`Just 68
about 69
as 122
much 29
right,' 191
said 137
the 1
Duchess, 13
`as 178
pigs 5
have 40
to 107
fly; 80
and 127
the 1
m--' 98
But 169
here, 4
to 107
Alice's 28
great 21
surprise, 27
the 1
Duchess's 19
voice 154
died 36
away, 78
even 130
in 165
the 1
middle 83
of 143
her 189
favourite 191
word 34
`moral,' 110
and 127
the 1
arm 60
that 23
was 81
linked 15
into 72
hers 174
began 49
to 107
tremble. 1
Alice 168
looked 98
up, 153
and 127
there 196
stood 83
the 1
Queen 50
in 165
front 113
of 143
them, 184
with 134
her 189
arms 175
folded, 116
frowning 144
like 151
a 97
thunderstorm. 17
`A 41
fine 98
day, 112
your 123
Majesty!' 185
the 1
Duchess 81
began 49
in 165
a 97
low, 32
weak 104
voice. 76
`Now, 118
I 73
give 137
you 39
fair 68
warning,' 1
shouted 0
the 1
Queen, 102
stamping 151
on 151
the 1
ground 1
as 122
she 40
spoke; 161
`either 139
you 39
or 155
your 123
head 32
must 137
be 139
off, 29
and 127
that 23
in 165
about 69
half 131
no 121
time! 4
Take 79
your 123
choice!' 135
The 49
Duchess 81
took 175
her 189
choice, 107
and 127
was 81
gone 55
in 165
a 97
moment. 14
`Let's 113
go 104
on 151
with 134
the 1
game,' 123
the 1
Queen 50
said 137
to 107
Alice; 67
and 127
Alice 168
was 81
too 28
much 29
frightened 154
to 107
say 43
a 97
word, 98
but 121
slowly 34
followed 88
her 189
back 111
to 107
the 1
croquet-ground. 181
The 49
other 176
guests 69
had 51
taken 31
advantage 29
of 143
the 1
Queen's 154
absence, 183
and 127
were 25
resting 70
in 165
the 1
shade: 131
however, 138
the 1
moment 0
they 152
saw 41
her, 103
they 152
hurried 83
back 111
to 107
the 1
game, 114
the 1
Queen 50
merely 112
remarking 42
that 23
a 97
moment's 132
delay 107
would 85
cost 61
them 140
their 130
lives. 73
All 121
the 1
time 141
they 152
were 25
playing 58
the 1
Queen 50
never 44
left 167
off 135
quarrelling 34
with 134
the 1
other 176
players, 82
and 127
shouting 183
`Off 119
with 134
his 114
head!' 82
or 155
`Off 119
with 134
her 189
head!' 82
Those 165
whom 23
she 40
sentenced 81
were 25
taken 31
into 72
custody 33
by 159
the 1
soldiers, 173
who 94
of 143
course 149
had 51
to 107
leave 135
off 135
being 167
arches 156
to 107
do 11
this, 14
so 76
that 23
by 159
the 1
end 171
of 143
half 131
an 117
hour 76
or 155
so 76
there 196
were 25
no 121
arches 156
left, 21
and 127
all 73
the 1
players, 82
except 167
the 1
King, 77
the 1
Queen, 102
and 127
Alice, 52
were 25
in 165
custody 33
and 127
under 112
sentence 195
of 143
execution. 102
Then 29
the 1
Queen 50
left 167
off, 29
quite 22
out 14
of 143
breath, 28
and 127
said 137
to 107
Alice, 52
`Have 144
you 39
seen 67
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
yet?' 0
`No,' 188
said 137
Alice. 54
`I 49
don't 136
even 130
know 107
what 196
a 97
Mock 154
Turtle 156
is.' 35
`It's 159
the 1
thing 118
Mock 154
Turtle 156
Soup 63
is 170
made 37
from,' 147
said 137
the 1
Queen. 100
`I 49
never 44
saw 41
one, 86
or 155
heard 126
of 143
one,' 105
said 137
Alice. 54
`Come 164
on, 125
then,' 192
said 137
the 1
Queen, 102
`and 63
he 125
shall 52
tell 73
you 39
his 114
history,' 135
As 130
they 152
walked 104
off 135
together, 82
Alice 168
heard 126
the 1
King 143
say 43
in 165
a 97
low 148
voice, 78
to 107
the 1
company 93
generally, 191
`You 23
are 52
all 73
pardoned.' 166
`Come, 168
THAT'S 69
a 97
good 85
thing!' 140
she 40
said 137
to 107
herself, 109
for 177
she 40
had 51
felt 7
quite 22
unhappy 177
at 123
the 1
number 87
of 143
executions 171
the 1
Queen 50
had 51
ordered. 97
They 40
very 54
soon 187
came 6
upon 130
a 97
Gryphon, 143
lying 197
fast 180
asleep 2
in 165
the 1
sun. 58
(IF 173
you 39
don't 136
know 107
what 196
a 97
Gryphon 53
is, 114
look 47
at 123
the 1
picture.) 119
`Up, 137
lazy 148
thing!' 140
said 137
the 1
Queen, 102
`and 63
take 191
this 70
young 192
lady 66
to 107
see 147
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle, 56
and 127
to 107
hear 46
his 114
history. 142
I 73
must 137
go 104
back 111
and 127
see 147
after 140
some 116
executions 171
I 73
have 40
ordered'; 15
and 127
she 40
walked 104
off, 29
leaving 84
Alice 168
alone 147
with 134
the 1
Gryphon. 145
Alice 168
did 55
not 67
quite 22
like 151
the 1
look 47
of 143
the 1
creature, 197
but 121
on 151
the 1
whole 183
she 40
thought 199
it 171
would 85
be 139
quite 22
as 122
safe 45
to 107
stay 169
with 134
it 171
as 122
to 107
go 104
after 140
that 23
savage 145
Queen: 88
so 76
she 40
waited. 154
The 49
Gryphon 53
sat 38
up 139
and 127
rubbed 198
its 16
eyes: 16
then 141
it 171
watched 6
the 1
Queen 50
till 117
she 40
was 81
out 14
of 143
sight: 155
then 141
it 171
chuckled. 11
`What 100
fun!' 61
said 137
the 1
Gryphon, 143
half 131
to 107
itself, 109
half 131
to 107
Alice. 54
`What 100
IS 146
the 1
fun?' 191
said 137
Alice. 54
`Why, 172
SHE,' 107
said 137
the 1
Gryphon. 145
`It's 159
all 73
her 189
fancy, 13
that: 171
they 152
never 44
executes 118
nobody, 17
you 39
know. 163
Come 148
on!' 173
`Everybody 93
says 48
"come 174
on!" 168
here,' 133
thought 199
Alice, 52
as 122
she 40
went 116
slowly 34
after 140
it: 159
`I 49
never 44
was 81
so 76
ordered 123
about 69
in 165
all 73
my 100
life, 120
never!' 138
They 40
had 51
not 67
gone 55
far 143
before 89
they 152
saw 41
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
in 165
the 1
distance, 167
sitting 76
sad 22
and 127
lonely 17
on 151
a 97
little 2
ledge 153
of 143
rock, 95
and, 181
as 122
they 152
came 6
nearer, 103
Alice 168
could 65
hear 46
him 108
sighing 11
as 122
if 157
his 114
heart 142
would 85
break. 33
She 88
pitied 187
him 108
deeply. 133
`What 100
is 170
his 114
sorrow?' 156
she 40
asked 160
the 1
Gryphon, 143
and 127
the 1
Gryphon 53
answered, 135
very 54
nearly 115
in 165
the 1
same 62
words 169
as 122
before, 155
`It's 159
all 73
his 114
fancy, 13
that: 171
he 125
hasn't 55
got 140
no 121
sorrow, 152
you 39
know. 163
Come 148
on!' 173
So 84
they 152
went 116
up 139
to 107
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle, 56
who 94
looked 98
at 123
them 140
with 134
large 43
eyes 18
full 175
of 143
tears, 69
but 121
said 137
nothing. 17
`This 174
here 160
young 192
lady,' 67
said 137
the 1
Gryphon, 143
`she 176
wants 147
for 177
to 107
know 107
your 123
history, 144
she 40
do.' 36
`I'll 94
tell 73
it 171
her,' 32
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
in 165
a 97
deep, 168
hollow 185
tone: 136
`sit 22
down, 114
both 89
of 143
you, 53
and 127
don't 136
speak 82
a 97
word 34
till 117
I've 181
finished.' 107
So 84
they 152
sat 38
down, 114
and 127
nobody 45
spoke 196
for 177
some 116
minutes. 17
Alice 168
thought 199
to 107
herself, 109
`I 49
don't 136
see 147
how 104
he 125
can 56
EVEN 42
finish, 47
if 157
he 125
doesn't 66
begin.' 134
But 169
she 40
waited 28
patiently. 108
`Once,' 68
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
at 123
last, 150
with 134
a 97
deep 4
sigh, 21
`I 49
was 81
a 97
real 150
Turtle.' 157
These 155
words 169
were 25
followed 88
by 159
a 97
very 54
long 12
silence, 59
broken 35
only 180
by 159
an 117
occasional 82
exclamation 149
of 143
`Hjckrrh!' 36
from 186
the 1
Gryphon, 143
and 127
the 1
constant 164
heavy 71
sobbing 130
of 143
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle. 58
Alice 168
was 81
very 54
nearly 115
getting 108
up 139
and 127
saying, 101
`Thank 38
you, 53
sir, 48
for 177
your 123
interesting 24
story,' 80
but 121
she 40
could 65
not 67
help 185
thinking 80
there 196
MUST 49
be 139
more 125
to 107
come, 104
so 76
she 40
sat 38
still 32
and 127
said 137
nothing. 17
`When 18
we 190
were 25
little,' 193
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
went 116
on 151
at 123
last, 150
more 125
calmly, 120
though 61
still 32
sobbing 130
a 97
little 2
now 70
and 127
then, 15
`we 46
went 116
to 107
school 68
in 165
the 1
sea. 79
The 49
master 14
was 81
an 117
old 119
Turtle--we 174
used 93
to 107
call 182
him 108
Tortoise--' 170
`Why 88
did 55
you 39
call 182
him 108
Tortoise, 155
if 157
he 125
wasn't 190
one?' 94
Alice 168
asked. 90
`We 54
called 163
him 108
Tortoise 15
because 18
he 125
taught 173
us,' 65
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
angrily: 44
`really 21
you 39
are 52
very 54
dull!' 161
`You 23
ought 101
to 107
be 139
ashamed 103
of 143
yourself 145
for 177
asking 79
such 175
a 97
simple 126
question,' 193
added 168
the 1
Gryphon; 158
and 127
then 141
they 152
both 89
sat 38
silent 11
and 127
looked 98
at 123
poor 18
Alice, 52
who 94
felt 7
ready 123
to 107
sink 187
into 72
the 1
earth. 188
At 131
last 126
the 1
Gryphon 53
said 137
to 107
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle, 56
`Drive 134
on, 125
old 119
fellow! 110
Don't 64
be 139
all 73
day 28
about 69
it!' 193
and 127
he 125
went 116
on 151
in 165
these 27
words: 199
`Yes, 85
we 190
went 116
to 107
school 68
in 165
the 1
sea, 77
though 61
you 39
mayn't 154
believe 84
it--' 140
`I 49
never 44
said 137
I 73
didn't!' 46
interrupted 142
Alice. 54
`You 23
did,' 58
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle. 58
`Hold 87
your 123
tongue!' 22
added 168
the 1
Gryphon, 143
before 89
Alice 168
could 65
speak 82
again. 98
The 49
Mock 154
Turtle 156
went 116
on. 127
`We 54
had 51
the 1
best 60
of 143
educations--in 184
fact, 48
we 190
went 116
to 107
school 68
every 75
day--' 69
`I'VE 173
been 20
to 107
a 97
day-school, 137
too,' 111
said 137
Alice; 67
`you 175
needn't 109
be 139
so 76
proud 124
as 122
all 73
that.' 128
`With 38
extras?' 133
asked 160
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
a 97
little 2
anxiously. 138
`Yes,' 22
said 137
Alice, 52
`we 46
learned 43
French 138
and 127
music.' 62
`And 111
washing?' 37
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle. 58
`Certainly 113
not!' 49
said 137
Alice 168
indignantly. 101
`Ah! 58
then 141
yours 128
wasn't 190
a 97
really 77
good 85
school,' 57
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
in 165
a 97
tone 138
of 143
great 21
relief. 173
`Now 54
at 123
OURS 199
they 152
had 51
at 123
the 1
end 171
of 143
the 1
bill, 93
"French, 128
music, 97
AND 151
WASHING--extra."' 90
`You 23
couldn't 118
have 40
wanted 73
it 171
much,' 24
said 137
Alice; 67
`living 71
at 123
the 1
bottom 85
of 143
the 1
sea.' 88
`I 49
couldn't 118
afford 120
to 107
learn 20
it.' 196
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
with 134
a 97
sigh. 23
`I 49
only 180
took 175
the 1
regular 100
course.' 36
`What 100
was 81
that?' 1
inquired 9
Alice. 54
`Reeling 152
and 127
Writhing, 44
of 143
course, 185
to 107
begin 97
with,' 119
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
replied; 102
`and 63
then 141
the 1
different 9
branches 24
of 143
Arithmetic-- 130
Ambition, 19
Distraction, 10
Uglification, 168
and 127
Derision.' 30
`I 49
never 44
heard 126
of 143
"Uglification,"' 131
Alice 168
ventured 31
to 107
say. 179
`What 100
is 170
it?' 123
The 49
Gryphon 53
lifted 94
up 139
both 89
its 16
paws 13
in 165
surprise. 29
`What! 163
Never 172
heard 126
of 143
uglifying!' 6
it 171
exclaimed. 158
`You 23
know 107
what 196
to 107
beautify 103
is, 114
I 73
suppose?' 25
`Yes,' 22
said 137
Alice 168
doubtfully: 156
`it 27
means--to--make--anything--prettier.' 35
`Well, 2
then,' 192
the 1
Gryphon 53
went 116
on, 125
`if 13
you 39
don't 136
know 107
what 196
to 107
uglify 150
is, 114
you 39
ARE 76
a 97
simpleton.' 166
Alice 168
did 55
not 67
feel 182
encouraged 175
to 107
ask 89
any 148
more 125
questions 3
about 69
it, 145
so 76
she 40
turned 108
to 107
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle, 56
and 127
said 137
`What 100
else 145
had 51
you 39
to 107
learn?' 4
`Well, 2
there 196
was 81
Mystery,' 58
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
replied, 117
counting 37
off 135
the 1
subjects 145
on 151
his 114
flappers, 183
`--Mystery, 3
ancient 128
and 127
modern, 181
with 134
Seaography: 41
then 141
Drawling--the 39
Drawling-master 99
was 81
an 117
old 119
conger-eel, 53
that 23
used 93
to 107
come 60
once 81
a 97
week: 126
HE 101
taught 173
us 142
Drawling, 142
Stretching, 81
and 127
Fainting 142
in 165
Coils.' 139
`What 100
was 81
THAT 135
like?' 193
said 137
Alice. 54
`Well, 2
I 73
can't 141
show 69
it 171
you 39
myself,' 35
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
said: 105
`I'm 7
too 28
stiff. 10
And 175
the 1
Gryphon 53
never 44
learnt 160
it.' 196
`Hadn't 0
time,' 192
said 137
the 1
Gryphon: 157
`I 49
went 116
to 107
the 1
Classics 9
master, 178
though. 69
He 133
was 81
an 117
old 119
crab, 52
HE 101
was.' 106
`I 49
never 44
went 116
to 107
him,' 191
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
said 137
with 134
a 97
sigh: 35
`he 181
taught 173
Laughing 63
and 127
Grief, 37
they 152
used 93
to 107
say.' 188
`So 140
he 125
did, 149
so 76
he 125
did,' 58
said 137
the 1
Gryphon, 143
sighing 11
in 165
his 114
turn; 6
and 127
both 89
creatures 68
hid 99
their 130
faces 54
in 165
their 130
paws. 49
`And 111
how 104
many 167
hours 71
a 97
day 28
did 55
you 39
do 11
lessons?' 139
said 137
Alice, 52
in 165
a 97
hurry 140
to 107
change 32
the 1
subject. 14
`Ten 101
hours 71
the 1
first 32
day,' 111
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle: 70
`nine 42
the 1
next, 161
and 127
so 76
on.' 176
`What 100
a 97
curious 132
plan!' 17
exclaimed 144
Alice. 54
`That's 51
the 1
reason 68
they're 54
called 163
lessons,' 150
the 1
Gryphon 53
remarked: 43
`because 2
they 152
lessen 46
from 186
day 28
to 107
day.' 173
This 158
was 81
quite 22
a 97
new 160
idea 183
to 107
Alice, 52
and 127
she 40
thought 199
it 171
over 44
a 97
little 2
before 89
she 40
made 37
her 189
next 107
remark. 14
`Then 45
the 1
eleventh 131
day 28
must 137
have 40
been 20
a 97
holiday?' 32
`Of 7
course 149
it 171
was,' 44
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle. 58
`And 111
how 104
did 55
you 39
manage 179
on 151
the 1
twelfth?' 64
Alice 168
went 116
on 151
eagerly. 127
`That's 51
enough 0
about 69
lessons,' 150
the 1
Gryphon 53
interrupted 142
in 165
a 97
very 54
decided 100
tone: 136
`tell 89
her 189
something 182
about 69
the 1
games 185
now.' 135
CHAPTER 45
X 88
The 49
Lobster 125
Quadrille 71
The 49
Mock 154
Turtle 156
sighed 178
deeply, 131
and 127
drew 104
the 1
back 111
of 143
one 182
flapper 136
across 145
his 114
eyes. 4
He 133
looked 98
at 123
Alice, 52
and 127
tried 146
to 107
speak, 110
but 121
for 177
a 97
minute 188
or 155
two 76
sobs 189
choked 104
his 114
voice. 76
`Same 166
as 122
if 157
he 125
had 51
a 97
bone 100
in 165
his 114
throat,' 111
said 137
the 1
Gryphon: 157
and 127
it 171
set 162
to 107
work 41
shaking 107
him 108
and 127
punching 148
him 108
in 165
the 1
back. 87
At 131
last 126
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
recovered 43
his 114
voice, 78
and, 181
with 134
tears 193
running 135
down 170
his 114
cheeks, 55
he 125
went 116
on 151
again:-- 122
`You 23
may 77
not 67
have 40
lived 152
much 29
under 112
the 1
sea--' 104
(`I 89
haven't,' 26
said 137
Alice)-- 185
`and 63
perhaps 119
you 39
were 25
never 44
even 130
introduced 197
to 107
a 97
lobster--' 46
(Alice 8
began 49
to 107
say 43
`I 49
once 81
tasted--' 178
but 121
checked 95
herself 33
hastily, 88
and 127
said 137
`No, 179
never') 126
`--so 132
you 39
can 56
have 40
no 121
idea 183
what 196
a 97
delightful 48
thing 118
a 97
Lobster 125
Quadrille 71
is!' 32
`No, 179
indeed,' 64
said 137
Alice. 54
`What 100
sort 86
of 143
a 97
dance 107
is 170
it?' 123
`Why,' 125
said 137
the 1
Gryphon, 143
`you 175
first 32
form 196
into 72
a 97
line 44
along 149
the 1
sea-shore--' 192
`Two 60
lines!' 173
cried 89
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle. 58
`Seals, 134
turtles, 173
salmon, 70
and 127
so 76
on; 140
then, 15
when 114
you've 9
cleared 44
all 73
the 1
jelly-fish 113
out 14
of 143
the 1
way--' 0
`THAT 151
generally 69
takes 36
some 116
time,' 192
interrupted 142
the 1
Gryphon. 145
`--you 121
advance 174
twice--' 191
`Each 185
with 134
a 97
lobster 45
as 122
a 97
partner!' 26
cried 89
the 1
Gryphon. 145
`Of 7
course,' 98
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
said: 105
`advance 158
twice, 12
set 162
to 107
partners--' 68
`--change 112
lobsters, 42
and 127
retire 165
in 165
same 62
order,' 151
continued 35
the 1
Gryphon. 145
`Then, 57
you 39
know,' 66
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
went 116
on, 125
`you 175
throw 14
the--' 26
`The 185
lobsters!' 148
shouted 0
the 1
Gryphon, 143
with 134
a 97
bound 6
into 72
the 1
air. 12
`--as 178
far 143
out 14
to 107
sea 143
as 122
you 39
can--' 121
`Swim 192
after 140
them!' 94
screamed 42
the 1
Gryphon. 145
`Turn 141
a 97
somersault 159
in 165
the 1
sea!' 85
cried 89
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle, 56
capering 109
wildly 25
about. 111
`Change 88
lobsters 118
again!' 42
yelled 157
the 1
Gryphon 53
at 123
the 1
top 29
of 143
its 16
voice. 76
`Back 15
to 107
land 155
again, 100
and 127
that's 69
all 73
the 1
first 32
figure,' 121
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle, 56
suddenly 40
dropping 183
his 114
voice; 63
and 127
the 1
two 76
creatures, 168
who 94
had 51
been 20
jumping 156
about 69
like 151
mad 56
things 123
all 73
this 70
time, 15
sat 38
down 170
again 192
very 54
sadly 11
and 127
quietly, 69
and 127
looked 98
at 123
Alice. 54
`It 35
must 137
be 139
a 97
very 54
pretty 106
dance,' 14
said 137
Alice 168
timidly. 106
`Would 187
you 39
like 151
to 107
see 147
a 97
little 2
of 143
it?' 123
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle. 58
`Very 158
much 29
indeed,' 64
said 137
Alice. 54
`Come, 168
let's 159
try 131
the 1
first 32
figure!' 62
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
to 107
the 1
Gryphon. 145
`We 54
can 56
do 11
without 8
lobsters, 42
you 39
know. 163
Which 69
shall 52
sing?' 41
`Oh, 123
YOU 63
sing,' 30
said 137
the 1
Gryphon. 145
`I've 197
forgotten 154
the 1
words.' 74
So 84
they 152
began 49
solemnly 123
dancing 168
round 142
and 127
round 142
Alice, 52
every 75
now 70
and 127
then 141
treading 184
on 151
her 189
toes 73
when 114
they 152
passed 136
too 28
close, 188
and 127
waving 34
their 130
forepaws 169
to 107
mark 77
the 1
time, 15
while 17
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
sang 95
this, 14
very 54
slowly 34
and 127
sadly:-- 7
`"Will 108
you 39
walk 1
a 97
little 2
faster?" 108
said 137
a 97
whiting 22
to 107
a 97
snail. 195
"There's 194
a 97
porpoise 25
close 144
behind 198
us, 46
and 127
he's 49
treading 184
on 151
my 100
tail. 62
See 195
how 104
eagerly 107
the 1
lobsters 118
and 127
the 1
turtles 153
all 73
advance! 193
They 40
are 52
waiting 165
on 151
the 1
shingle--will 0
you 39
come 60
and 127
join 82
the 1
dance? 116
Will 178
you, 53
won't 35
you, 53
will 90
you, 53
won't 35
you, 53
will 90
you 39
join 82
the 1
dance? 116
Will 178
you, 53
won't 35
you, 53
will 90
you, 53
won't 35
you, 53
won't 35
you 39
join 82
the 1
dance? 116
"You 181
can 56
really 77
have 40
no 121
notion 43
how 104
delightful 48
it 171
will 90
be 139
When 2
they 152
take 191
us 142
up 139
and 127
throw 14
us, 46
with 134
the 1
lobsters, 42
out 14
to 107
sea!" 80
But 169
the 1
snail 105
replied 97
"Too 170
far, 77
too 28
far!" 80
and 127
gave 49
a 97
look 47
askance-- 136
Said 25
he 125
thanked 95
the 1
whiting 22
kindly, 93
but 121
he 125
would 85
not 67
join 82
the 1
dance. 133
Would 13
not, 121
could 65
not, 121
would 85
not, 121
could 65
not, 121
would 85
not 67
join 82
the 1
dance. 133
Would 13
not, 121
could 65
not, 121
would 85
not, 121
could 65
not, 121
could 65
not 67
join 82
the 1
dance. 133
`"What 2
matters 170
it 171
how 104
far 143
we 190
go?" 131
his 114
scaly 110
friend 74
replied. 115
"There 58
is 170
another 173
shore, 17
you 39
know, 161
upon 130
the 1
other 176
side. 47
The 49
further 44
off 135
from 186
England 177
the 1
nearer 139
is 170
to 107
France-- 37
Then 29
turn 37
not 67
pale, 42
beloved 129
snail, 197
but 121
come 60
and 127
join 82
the 1
dance. 133
Will 178
you, 53
won't 35
you, 53
will 90
you, 53
won't 35
you, 53
will 90
you 39
join 82
the 1
dance? 116
Will 178
you, 53
won't 35
you, 53
will 90
you, 53
won't 35
you, 53
won't 35
you 39
join 82
the 1
dance?"' 17
`Thank 38
you, 53
it's 55
a 97
very 54
interesting 24
dance 107
to 107
watch,' 178
said 137
Alice, 52
feeling 132
very 54
glad 168
that 23
it 171
was 81
over 44
at 123
last: 164
`and 63
I 73
do 11
so 76
like 151
that 23
curious 132
song 149
about 69
the 1
whiting!' 116
`Oh, 123
as 122
to 107
the 1
whiting,' 175
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle, 56
`they--you've 79
seen 67
them, 184
of 143
course?' 109
`Yes,' 22
said 137
Alice, 52
`I've 197
often 30
seen 67
them 140
at 123
dinn--' 138
she 40
checked 95
herself 33
hastily. 90
`I 49
don't 136
know 107
where 159
Dinn 13
may 77
be,' 182
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle, 56
`but 57
if 157
you've 9
seen 67
them 140
so 76
often, 122
of 143
course 149
you 39
know 107
what 196
they're 54
like.' 120
`I 49
believe 84
so,' 39
Alice 168
replied 97
thoughtfully. 83
`They 56
have 40
their 130
tails 131
in 165
their 130
mouths--and 35
they're 54
all 73
over 44
crumbs.' 87
`You're 187
wrong 157
about 69
the 1
crumbs,' 149
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle: 70
`crumbs 48
would 85
all 73
wash 15
off 135
in 165
the 1
sea. 79
But 169
they 152
HAVE 152
their 130
tails 131
in 165
their 130
mouths; 63
and 127
the 1
reason 68
is--' 149
here 160
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
yawned 18
and 127
shut 52
his 114
eyes.--`Tell 131
her 189
about 69
the 1
reason 68
and 127
all 73
that,' 190
he 125
said 137
to 107
the 1
Gryphon. 145
`The 185
reason 68
is,' 173
said 137
the 1
Gryphon, 143
`that 39
they 152
WOULD 125
go 104
with 134
the 1
lobsters 118
to 107
the 1
dance. 133
So 84
they 152
got 140
thrown 152
out 14
to 107
sea. 79
So 84
they 152
had 51
to 107
fall 155
a 97
long 12
way. 143
So 84
they 152
got 140
their 130
tails 131
fast 180
in 165
their 130
mouths. 50
So 84
they 152
couldn't 118
get 30
them 140
out 14
again. 98
That's 101
all.' 18
`Thank 38
you,' 82
said 137
Alice, 52
`it's 71
very 54
interesting. 46
I 73
never 44
knew 197
so 76
much 29
about 69
a 97
whiting 22
before.' 88
`I 49
can 56
tell 73
you 39
more 125
than 17
that, 157
if 157
you 39
like,' 182
said 137
the 1
Gryphon. 145
`Do 75
you 39
know 107
why 104
it's 55
called 163
a 97
whiting?' 186
`I 49
never 44
thought 199
about 69
it,' 134
said 137
Alice. 54
`Why?' 136
`IT 3
DOES 129
THE 25
BOOTS 81
AND 151
SHOES.' 167
the 1
Gryphon 53
replied 97
very 54
solemnly. 197
Alice 168
was 81
thoroughly 171
puzzled. 96
`Does 121
the 1
boots 41
and 127
shoes!' 14
she 40
repeated 190
in 165
a 97
wondering 183
tone. 124
`Why, 172
what 196
are 52
YOUR 35
shoes 96
done 82
with?' 130
said 137
the 1
Gryphon. 145
`I 49
mean, 151
what 196
makes 189
them 140
so 76
shiny?' 103
Alice 168
looked 98
down 170
at 123
them, 184
and 127
considered 120
a 97
little 2
before 89
she 40
gave 49
her 189
answer. 64
`They're 42
done 82
with 134
blacking, 153
I 73
believe.' 59
`Boots 31
and 127
shoes 96
under 112
the 1
sea,' 26
the 1
Gryphon 53
went 116
on 151
in 165
a 97
deep 4
voice, 78
`are 188
done 82
with 134
a 97
whiting. 32
Now 118
you 39
know.' 4
`And 111
what 196
are 52
they 152
made 37
of?' 15
Alice 168
asked 160
in 165
a 97
tone 138
of 143
great 21
curiosity. 107
`Soles 122
and 127
eels, 109
of 143
course,' 98
the 1
Gryphon 53
replied 97
rather 0
impatiently: 196
`any 84
shrimp 177
could 65
have 40
told 75
you 39
that.' 128
`If 21
I'd 62
been 20
the 1
whiting,' 175
said 137
Alice, 52
whose 0
thoughts 106
were 25
still 32
running 135
on 151
the 1
song, 63
`I'd 198
have 40
said 137
to 107
the 1
porpoise, 139
"Keep 143
back, 85
please: 72
we 190
don't 136
want 72
YOU 63
with 134
us!"' 128
`They 56
were 25
obliged 178
to 107
have 40
him 108
with 134
them,' 153
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
said: 105
`no 177
wise 100
fish 56
would 85
go 104
anywhere 13
without 8
a 97
porpoise.' 138
`Wouldn't 66
it 171
really?' 141
said 137
Alice 168
in 165
a 97
tone 138
of 143
great 21
surprise. 29
`Of 7
course 149
not,' 190
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle: 70
`why, 84
if 157
a 97
fish 56
came 6
to 107
ME, 180
and 127
told 75
me 80
he 125
was 81
going 82
a 97
journey, 4
I 73
should 61
say 43
"With 136
what 196
porpoise?"' 139
`Don't 136
you 39
mean 197
"purpose"?' 34
said 137
Alice. 54
`I 49
mean 197
what 196
I 73
say,' 126
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
replied 97
in 165
an 117
offended 21
tone. 124
And 175
the 1
Gryphon 53
added 168
`Come, 168
let's 159
hear 46
some 116
of 143
YOUR 35
adventures.' 100
`I 49
could 65
tell 73
you 39
my 100
adventures--beginning 54
from 186
this 70
morning,' 55
said 137
Alice 168
a 97
little 2
timidly: 94
`but 57
it's 55
no 121
use 103
going 82
back 111
to 107
yesterday, 2
because 18
I 73
was 81
a 97
different 9
person 123
then.' 130
`Explain 47
all 73
that,' 190
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle. 58
`No, 179
no! 184
The 49
adventures 189
first,' 157
said 137
the 1
Gryphon 53
in 165
an 117
impatient 7
tone: 136
`explanations 74
take 191
such 175
a 97
dreadful 61
time.' 130
So 84
Alice 168
began 49
telling 39
them 140
her 189
adventures 189
from 186
the 1
time 141
when 114
she 40
first 32
saw 41
the 1
White 193
Rabbit. 116
She 88
was 81
a 97
little 2
nervous 98
about 69
it 171
just 164
at 123
first, 60
the 1
two 76
creatures 68
got 140
so 76
close 144
to 107
her, 103
one 182
on 151
each 81
side, 45
and 127
opened 151
their 130
eyes 18
and 127
mouths 44
so 76
VERY 166
wide, 129
but 121
she 40
gained 10
courage 6
as 122
she 40
went 116
on. 127
Her 37
listeners 169
were 25
perfectly 162
quiet 172
till 117
she 40
got 140
to 107
the 1
part 59
about 69
her 189
repeating 145
`YOU 199
ARE 76
OLD, 77
FATHER 92
WILLIAM,' 190
to 107
the 1
Caterpillar, 49
and 127
the 1
words 169
all 73
coming 79
different, 59
and 127
then 141
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
drew 104
a 97
long 12
breath, 28
and 127
said 137
`That's 51
very 54
curious.' 125
`It's 159
all 73
about 69
as 122
curious 132
as 122
it 171
can 56
be,' 182
said 137
the 1
Gryphon. 145
`It 35
all 73
came 6
different!' 175
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
repeated 190
thoughtfully. 83
`I 49
should 61
like 151
to 107
hear 46
her 189
try 131
and 127
repeat 85
something 182
now. 16
Tell 161
her 189
to 107
begin.' 134
He 133
looked 98
at 123
the 1
Gryphon 53
as 122
if 157
he 125
thought 199
it 171
had 51
some 116
kind 52
of 143
authority 35
over 44
Alice. 54
`Stand 74
up 139
and 127
repeat 85
"'TIS 33
THE 25
VOICE 194
OF 119
THE 25
SLUGGARD,"' 14
said 137
the 1
Gryphon. 145
`How 88
the 1
creatures 68
order 150
one 182
about, 113
and 127
make 54
one 182
repeat 85
lessons!' 9
thought 199
Alice; 67
`I 49
might 167
as 122
well 46
be 139
at 123
school 68
at 123
once.' 190
However, 10
she 40
got 140
up, 153
and 127
began 49
to 107
repeat 85
it, 145
but 121
her 189
head 32
was 81
so 76
full 175
of 143
the 1
Lobster 125
Quadrille, 139
that 23
she 40
hardly 112
knew 197
what 196
she 40
was 81
saying, 101
and 127
the 1
words 169
came 6
very 54
queer 126
indeed:-- 27
`'Tis 159
the 1
voice 154
of 143
the 1
Lobster; 190
I 73
heard 126
him 108
declare, 2
"You 181
have 40
baked 43
me 80
too 28
brown, 90
I 73
must 137
sugar 166
my 100
hair." 186
As 130
a 97
duck 113
with 134
its 16
eyelids, 113
so 76
he 125
with 134
his 114
nose 147
Trims 137
his 114
belt 43
and 127
his 114
buttons, 61
and 127
turns 62
out 14
his 114
toes.' 78
[later 39
editions 125
continued 35
as 122
follows 118
When 2
the 1
sands 167
are 52
all 73
dry, 49
he 125
is 170
gay 111
as 122
a 97
lark, 110
And 175
will 90
talk 28
in 165
contemptuous 186
tones 193
of 143
the 1
Shark, 137
But, 83
when 114
the 1
tide 62
rises 10
and 127
sharks 34
are 52
around, 113
His 162
voice 154
has 66
a 97
timid 195
and 127
tremulous 96
sound.] 138
`That's 51
different 9
from 186
what 196
I 73
used 93
to 107
say 43
when 114
I 73
was 81
a 97
child,' 143
said 137
the 1
Gryphon. 145
`Well, 2
I 73
never 44
heard 126
it 171
before,' 26
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle; 71
`but 57
it 171
sounds 28
uncommon 12
nonsense.' 42
Alice 168
said 137
nothing; 30
she 40
had 51
sat 38
down 170
with 134
her 189
face 69
in 165
her 189
hands, 136
wondering 183
if 157
anything 54
would 85
EVER 46
happen 190
in 165
a 97
natural 1
way 87
again. 98
`I 49
should 61
like 151
to 107
have 40
it 171
explained,' 39
said 137
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle. 58
`She 24
can't 141
explain 49
it,' 134
said 137
the 1
Gryphon 53
hastily. 90
`Go 168
on 151
with 134
the 1
next 107
verse.' 94
`But 105
about 69
his 114
toes?' 151
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
persisted. 107
`How 88
COULD 105
he 125
turn 37
them 140
out 14
with 134
his 114
nose, 1
you 39
know?' 77
`It's 159
the 1
first 32
position 169
in 165
dancing.' 199
Alice 168
said; 106
but 121
was 81
dreadfully 192
puzzled 82
by 159
the 1
whole 183
thing, 194
and 127
longed 133
to 107
change 32
the 1
subject. 14
`Go 168
on 151
with 134
the 1
next 107
verse,' 32
the 1
Gryphon 53
repeated 190
impatiently: 196
`it 27
begins 174
"I 127
passed 136
by 159
his 114
garden."' 150
Alice 168
did 55
not 67
dare 152
to 107
disobey, 127
though 61
she 40
felt 7
sure 37
it 171
would 85
all 73
come 60
wrong, 185
and 127
she 40
went 116
on 151
in 165
a 97
trembling 2
voice:-- 88
`I 49
passed 136
by 159
his 114
garden, 113
and 127
marked, 104
with 134
one 182
eye, 147
How 152
the 1
Owl 116
and 127
the 1
Panther 150
were 25
sharing 44
a 97
pie--' 109
[later 39
editions 125
continued 35
as 122
follows 118
The 49
Panther 150
took 175
pie-crust, 42
and 127
gravy, 29
and 127
meat, 137
While 145
the 1
Owl 116
had 51
the 1
dish 74
as 122
its 16
share 31
of 143
the 1
treat. 36
When 2
the 1
pie 188
was 81
all 73
finished, 90
the 1
Owl, 40
as 122
a 97
boon, 184
Was 129
kindly 55
permitted 112
to 107
pocket 170
the 1
spoon: 39
While 145
the 1
Panther 150
received 103
knife 125
and 127
fork 194
with 134
a 97
growl, 197
And 175
concluded 39
the 1
banquet--] 171
`What 100
IS 146
the 1
use 103
of 143
repeating 145
all 73
that 23
stuff,' 105
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
interrupted, 14
`if 13
you 39
don't 136
explain 49
it 171
as 122
you 39
go 104
on? 144
It's 143
by 159
far 143
the 1
most 171
confusing 192
thing 118
I 73
ever 134
heard!' 36
`Yes, 85
I 73
think 122
you'd 188
better 0
leave 135
off,' 138
said 137
the 1
Gryphon: 157
and 127
Alice 168
was 81
only 180
too 28
glad 168
to 107
do 11
so. 2
`Shall 20
we 190
try 131
another 173
figure 44
of 143
the 1
Lobster 125
Quadrille?' 97
the 1
Gryphon 53
went 116
on. 127
`Or 19
would 85
you 39
like 151
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
to 107
sing 183
you 39
a 97
song?' 115
`Oh, 123
a 97
song, 63
please, 86
if 157
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
would 85
be 139
so 76
kind,' 121
Alice 168
replied, 117
so 76
eagerly 107
that 23
the 1
Gryphon 53
said, 91
in 165
a 97
rather 0
offended 21
tone, 122
`Hm! 140
No 129
accounting 43
for 177
tastes! 27
Sing 71
her 189
"Turtle 74
Soup," 155
will 90
you, 53
old 119
fellow?' 31
The 49
Mock 154
Turtle 156
sighed 178
deeply, 131
and 127
began, 133
in 165
a 97
voice 154
sometimes 14
choked 104
with 134
sobs, 103
to 107
sing 183
this:-- 52
`Beautiful 111
Soup, 197
so 76
rich 52
and 127
green, 143
Waiting 51
in 165
a 97
hot 101
tureen! 148
Who 142
for 177
such 175
dainties 173
would 85
not 67
stoop? 88
Soup 63
of 143
the 1
evening, 20
beautiful 183
Soup! 186
Soup 63
of 143
the 1
evening, 20
beautiful 183
Soup! 186
Beau--ootiful 7
Soo--oop! 196
Beau--ootiful 7
Soo--oop! 196
Soo--oop 149
of 143
the 1
e--e--evening, 108
Beautiful, 13
beautiful 183
Soup! 186
`Beautiful 111
Soup! 186
Who 142
cares 106
for 177
fish, 180
Game, 42
or 155
any 148
other 176
dish? 157
Who 142
would 85
not 67
give 137
all 73
else 145
for 177
two 76
Pennyworth 10
only 180
of 143
beautiful 183
Soup? 16
Pennyworth 10
only 180
of 143
beautiful 183
Soup? 16
Beau--ootiful 7
Soo--oop! 196
Beau--ootiful 7
Soo--oop! 196
Soo--oop 149
of 143
the 1
e--e--evening, 108
Beautiful, 13
beauti--FUL 87
SOUP!' 27
`Chorus 54
again!' 42
cried 89
the 1
Gryphon, 143
and 127
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle 156
had 51
just 164
begun 69
to 107
repeat 85
it, 145
when 114
a 97
cry 194
of 143
`The 185
trial's 46
beginning!' 187
was 81
heard 126
in 165
the 1
distance. 169
`Come 164
on!' 173
cried 89
the 1
Gryphon, 143
and, 181
taking 188
Alice 168
by 159
the 1
hand, 165
it 171
hurried 83
off, 29
without 8
waiting 165
for 177
the 1
end 171
of 143
the 1
song. 65
`What 100
trial 30
is 170
it?' 123
Alice 168
panted 130
as 122
she 40
ran; 60
but 121
the 1
Gryphon 53
only 180
answered 3
`Come 164
on!' 173
and 127
ran 71
the 1
faster, 93
while 17
more 125
and 127
more 125
faintly 143
came, 30
carried 154
on 151
the 1
breeze 69
that 23
followed 88
them, 184
the 1
melancholy 190
words:-- 1
`Soo--oop 59
of 143
the 1
e--e--evening, 108
Beautiful, 13
beautiful 183
Soup!' 91
CHAPTER 45
XI 1
Who 142
Stole 119
the 1
Tarts? 197
The 49
King 143
and 127
Queen 50
of 143
Hearts 11
were 25
seated 76
on 151
their 130
throne 40
when 114
they 152
arrived, 153
with 134
a 97
great 21
crowd 13
assembled 26
about 69
them--all 155
sorts 181
of 143
little 2
birds 82
and 127
beasts, 40
as 122
well 46
as 122
the 1
whole 183
pack 185
of 143
cards: 113
the 1
Knave 61
was 81
standing 180
before 89
them, 184
in 165
chains, 18
with 134
a 97
soldier 6
on 151
each 81
side 71
to 107
guard 61
him; 7
and 127
near 192
the 1
King 143
was 81
the 1
White 193
Rabbit, 118
with 134
a 97
trumpet 135
in 165
one 182
hand, 165
and 127
a 97
scroll 51
of 143
parchment 76
in 165
the 1
other. 194
In 173
the 1
very 54
middle 83
of 143
the 1
court 67
was 81
a 97
table, 162
with 134
a 97
large 43
dish 74
of 143
tarts 28
upon 130
it: 159
they 152
looked 98
so 76
good, 79
that 23
it 171
made 37
Alice 168
quite 22
hungry 187
to 107
look 47
at 123
them--`I 189
wish 103
they'd 115
get 30
the 1
trial 30
done,' 91
she 40
thought, 35
`and 63
hand 191
round 142
the 1
refreshments!' 56
But 169
there 196
seemed 39
to 107
be 139
no 121
chance 156
of 143
this, 14
so 76
she 40
began 49
looking 187
at 123
everything 163
about 69
her, 103
to 107
pass 89
away 14
the 1
time. 17
Alice 168
had 51
never 44
been 20
in 165
a 97
court 67
of 143
justice 9
before, 155
but 121
she 40
had 51
read 142
about 69
them 140
in 165
books, 30
and 127
she 40
was 81
quite 22
pleased 30
to 107
find 97
that 23
she 40
knew 197
the 1
name 107
of 143
nearly 115
everything 163
there. 174
`That's 51
the 1
judge,' 118
she 40
said 137
to 107
herself, 109
`because 2
of 143
his 114
great 21
wig.' 102
The 49
judge, 75
by 159
the 1
way, 141
was 81
the 1
King; 92
and 127
as 122
he 125
wore 35
his 114
crown 23
over 44
the 1
wig, 71
(look 87
at 123
the 1
frontispiece 109
if 157
you 39
want 72
to 107
see 147
how 104
he 125
did 55
it,) 136
he 125
did 55
not 67
look 47
at 123
all 73
comfortable, 126
and 127
it 171
was 81
certainly 185
not 67
becoming. 182
`And 111
that's 69
the 1
jury-box,' 35
thought 199
Alice, 52
`and 63
those 37
twelve 143
creatures,' 113
(she 80
was 81
obliged 178
to 107
say 43
`creatures,' 177
you 39
see, 1
because 18
some 116
of 143
them 140
were 25
animals, 75
and 127
some 116
were 25
birds,) 9
`I 49
suppose 137
they 152
are 52
the 1
jurors.' 142
She 88
said 137
this 70
last 126
word 34
two 76
or 155
three 86
times 86
over 44
to 107
herself, 109
being 167
rather 0
proud 124
of 143
it: 159
for 177
she 40
thought, 35
and 127
rightly 57
too, 112
that 23
very 54
few 72
little 2
girls 135
of 143
her 189
age 111
knew 197
the 1
meaning 37
of 143
it 171
at 123
all. 109
However, 10
`jury-men' 92
would 85
have 40
done 82
just 164
as 122
well. 72
The 49
twelve 143
jurors 39
were 25
all 73
writing 132
very 54
busily 2
on 151
slates. 12
`What 100
are 52
they 152
doing?' 135
Alice 168
whispered 199
to 107
the 1
Gryphon. 145
`They 56
can't 141
have 40
anything 54
to 107
put 175
down 170
yet, 12
before 89
the 1
trial's 46
begun.' 42
`They're 42
putting 155
down 170
their 130
names,' 147
the 1
Gryphon 53
whispered 199
in 165
reply, 86
`for 113
fear 64
they 152
should 61
forget 59
them 140
before 89
the 1
end 171
of 143
the 1
trial.' 105
`Stupid 159
things!' 75
Alice 168
began 49
in 165
a 97
loud, 50
indignant 106
voice, 78
but 121
she 40
stopped 83
hastily, 88
for 177
the 1
White 193
Rabbit 110
cried 89
out, 78
`Silence 95
in 165
the 1
court!' 33
and 127
the 1
King 143
put 175
on 151
his 114
spectacles 41
and 127
looked 98
anxiously 92
round, 50
to 107
make 54
out 14
who 94
was 81
talking. 152
Alice 168
could 65
see, 1
as 122
well 46
as 122
if 157
she 40
were 25
looking 187
over 44
their 130
shoulders, 119
that 23
all 73
the 1
jurors 39
were 25
writing 132
down 170
`stupid 105
things!' 75
on 151
their 130
slates, 14
and 127
she 40
could 65
even 130
make 54
out 14
that 23
one 182
of 143
them 140
didn't 156
know 107
how 104
to 107
spell 24
`stupid,' 74
and 127
that 23
he 125
had 51
to 107
ask 89
his 114
neighbour 45
to 107
tell 73
him. 194
`A 41
nice 85
muddle 31
their 130
slates'll 93
be 139
in 165
before 89
the 1
trial's 46
over!' 150
thought 199
Alice. 54
One 30
of 143
the 1
jurors 39
had 51
a 97
pencil 51
that 23
squeaked. 7
This 158
of 143
course, 185
Alice 168
could 65
not 67
stand, 114
and 127
she 40
went 116
round 142
the 1
court 67
and 127
got 140
behind 198
him, 192
and 127
very 54
soon 187
found 90
an 117
opportunity 157
of 143
taking 188
it 171
away. 80
She 88
did 55
it 171
so 76
quickly 26
that 23
the 1
poor 18
little 2
juror 82
(it 11
was 81
Bill, 21
the 1
Lizard) 59
could 65
not 67
make 54
out 14
at 123
all 73
what 196
had 51
become 17
of 143
it; 160
so, 0
after 140
hunting 63
all 73
about 69
for 177
it, 145
he 125
was 81
obliged 178
to 107
write 175
with 134
one 182
finger 151
for 177
the 1
rest 116
of 143
the 1
day; 127
and 127
this 70
was 81
of 143
very 54
little 2
use, 37
as 122
it 171
left 167
no 121
mark 77
on 151
the 1
slate. 83
`Herald, 184
read 142
the 1
accusation!' 12
said 137
the 1
King. 79
On 159
this 70
the 1
White 193
Rabbit 110
blew 156
three 86
blasts 77
on 151
the 1
trumpet, 27
and 127
then 141
unrolled 19
the 1
parchment 76
scroll, 135
and 127
read 142
as 122
follows:-- 8
`The 185
Queen 50
of 143
Hearts, 57
she 40
made 37
some 116
tarts, 184
All 121
on 151
a 97
summer 161
day: 126
The 49
Knave 61
of 143
Hearts, 57
he 125
stole 191
those 37
tarts, 184
And 175
took 175
them 140
quite 22
away!' 180
`Consider 153
your 123
verdict,' 108
the 1
King 143
said 137
to 107
the 1
jury. 124
`Not 51
yet, 12
not 67
yet!' 70
the 1
Rabbit 110
hastily 4
interrupted. 12
`There's 176
a 97
great 21
deal 76
to 107
come 60
before 89
that!' 131
`Call 86
the 1
first 32
witness,' 156
said 137
the 1
King; 92
and 127
the 1
White 193
Rabbit 110
blew 156
three 86
blasts 77
on 151
the 1
trumpet, 27
and 127
called 163
out, 78
`First 40
witness!' 15
The 49
first 32
witness 81
was 81
the 1
Hatter. 24
He 133
came 6
in 165
with 134
a 97
teacup 154
in 165
one 182
hand 191
and 127
a 97
piece 38
of 143
bread-and-butter 141
in 165
the 1
other. 194
`I 49
beg 12
pardon, 166
your 123
Majesty,' 44
he 125
began, 133
`for 113
bringing 176
these 27
in: 173
but 121
I 73
hadn't 120
quite 22
finished 14
my 100
tea 104
when 114
I 73
was 81
sent 152
for.' 162
`You 23
ought 101
to 107
have 40
finished,' 45
said 137
the 1
King. 79
`When 18
did 55
you 39
begin?' 7
The 49
Hatter 10
looked 98
at 123
the 1
March 171
Hare, 168
who 94
had 51
followed 88
him 108
into 72
the 1
court, 175
arm-in-arm 179
with 134
the 1
Dormouse. 72
`Fourteenth 12
of 143
March, 151
I 73
think 122
it 171
was,' 44
he 125
said. 93
`Fifteenth,' 172
said 137
the 1
March 171
Hare. 170
`Sixteenth,' 171
added 168
the 1
Dormouse. 72
`Write 97
that 23
down,' 123
the 1
King 143
said 137
to 107
the 1
jury, 122
and 127
the 1
jury 138
eagerly 107
wrote 141
down 170
all 73
three 86
dates 149
on 151
their 130
slates, 14
and 127
then 141
added 168
them 140
up, 153
and 127
reduced 198
the 1
answer 170
to 107
shillings 13
and 127
pence. 37
`Take 95
off 135
your 123
hat,' 190
the 1
King 143
said 137
to 107
the 1
Hatter. 24
`It 35
isn't 105
mine,' 58
said 137
the 1
Hatter. 24
`Stolen!' 117
the 1
King 143
exclaimed, 156
turning 115
to 107
the 1
jury, 122
who 94
instantly 158
made 37
a 97
memorandum 175
of 143
the 1
fact. 50
`I 49
keep 141
them 140
to 107
sell,' 91
the 1
Hatter 10
added 168
as 122
an 117
explanation; 18
`I've 197
none 192
of 143
my 100
own. 16
I'm 71
a 97
hatter.' 111
Here 48
the 1
Queen 50
put 175
on 151
her 189
spectacles, 53
and 127
began 49
staring 40
at 123
the 1
Hatter, 26
who 94
turned 108
pale 58
and 127
fidgeted. 170
`Give 41
your 123
evidence,' 190
said 137
the 1
King; 92
`and 63
don't 136
be 139
nervous, 34
or 155
I'll 78
have 40
you 39
executed 103
on 151
the 1
spot.' 37
This 158
did 55
not 67
seem 66
to 107
encourage 101
the 1
witness 81
at 123
all: 121
he 125
kept 86
shifting 104
from 186
one 182
foot 110
to 107
the 1
other, 196
looking 187
uneasily 184
at 123
the 1
Queen, 102
and 127
in 165
his 114
confusion 154
he 125
bit 149
a 97
large 43
piece 38
out 14
of 143
his 114
teacup 154
instead 42
of 143
the 1
bread-and-butter. 155
Just 52
at 123
this 70
moment 0
Alice 168
felt 7
a 97
very 54
curious 132
sensation, 174
which 141
puzzled 82
her 189
a 97
good 85
deal 76
until 6
she 40
made 37
out 14
what 196
it 171
was: 169
she 40
was 81
beginning 115
to 107
grow 187
larger 49
again, 100
and 127
she 40
thought 199
at 123
first 32
she 40
would 85
get 30
up 139
and 127
leave 135
the 1
court; 160
but 121
on 151
second 20
thoughts 106
she 40
decided 100
to 107
remain 60
where 159
she 40
was 81
as 122
long 12
as 122
there 196
was 81
room 195
for 177
her. 105
`I 49
wish 103
you 39
wouldn't 14
squeeze 30
so.' 101
said 137
the 1
Dormouse, 74
who 94
was 81
sitting 76
next 107
to 107
her. 105
`I 49
can 56
hardly 112
breathe.' 122
`I 49
can't 141
help 185
it,' 134
said 137
Alice 168
very 54
meekly: 127
`I'm 7
growing.' 168
`You've 111
no 121
right 172
to 107
grow 187
here,' 133
said 137
the 1
Dormouse. 72
`Don't 136
talk 28
nonsense,' 180
said 137
Alice 168
more 125
boldly: 48
`you 175
know 107
you're 133
growing 23
too.' 173
`Yes, 85
but 121
I 73
grow 187
at 123
a 97
reasonable 166
pace,' 74
said 137
the 1
Dormouse: 60
`not 3
in 165
that 23
ridiculous 177
fashion.' 47
And 175
he 125
got 140
up 139
very 54
sulkily 139
and 127
crossed 159
over 44
to 107
the 1
other 176
side 71
of 143
the 1
court. 173
All 121
this 70
time 141
the 1
Queen 50
had 51
never 44
left 167
off 135
staring 40
at 123
the 1
Hatter, 26
and, 181
just 164
as 122
the 1
Dormouse 182
crossed 159
the 1
court, 175
she 40
said 137
to 107
one 182
of 143
the 1
officers 59
of 143
the 1
court, 175
`Bring 22
me 80
the 1
list 14
of 143
the 1
singers 159
in 165
the 1
last 126
concert!' 52
on 151
which 141
the 1
wretched 138
Hatter 10
trembled 55
so, 0
that 23
he 125
shook 198
both 89
his 114
shoes 96
off. 31
`Give 41
your 123
evidence,' 190
the 1
King 143
repeated 190
angrily, 58
`or 11
I'll 78
have 40
you 39
executed, 3
whether 109
you're 133
nervous 98
or 155
not.' 52
`I'm 7
a 97
poor 18
man, 90
your 123
Majesty,' 44
the 1
Hatter 10
began, 133
in 165
a 97
trembling 2
voice, 78
`--and 33
I 73
hadn't 120
begun 69
my 100
tea--not 29
above 85
a 97
week 28
or 155
so--and 157
what 196
with 134
the 1
bread-and-butter 141
getting 108
so 76
thin--and 122
the 1
twinkling 47
of 143
the 1
tea--' 153
`The 185
twinkling 47
of 143
the 1
what?' 148
said 137
the 1
King. 79
`It 35
began 49
with 134
the 1
tea,' 147
the 1
Hatter 10
replied. 115
`Of 7
course 149
twinkling 47
begins 174
with 134
a 97
T!' 186
said 137
the 1
King 143
sharply. 57
`Do 75
you 39
take 191
me 80
for 177
a 97
dunce? 96
Go 112
on!' 173
`I'm 7
a 97
poor 18
man,' 29
the 1
Hatter 10
went 116
on, 125
`and 63
most 171
things 123
twinkled 8
after 140
that--only 61
the 1
March 171
Hare 4
said--' 142
`I 49
didn't!' 46
the 1
March 171
Hare 4
interrupted 142
in 165
a 97
great 21
hurry. 110
`You 23
did!' 117
said 137
the 1
Hatter. 24
`I 49
deny 92
it!' 193
said 137
the 1
March 171
Hare. 170
`He 189
denies 14
it,' 134
said 137
the 1
King: 91
`leave 65
out 14
that 23
part.' 132
`Well, 2
at 123
any 148
rate, 172
the 1
Dormouse 182
said--' 142
the 1
Hatter 10
went 116
on, 125
looking 187
anxiously 92
round 142
to 107
see 147
if 157
he 125
would 85
deny 92
it 171
too: 126
but 121
the 1
Dormouse 182
denied 29
nothing, 15
being 167
fast 180
asleep. 56
`After 132
that,' 190
continued 35
the 1
Hatter, 26
`I 49
cut 82
some 116
more 125
bread- 51
and-butter--' 71
`But 105
what 196
did 55
the 1
Dormouse 182
say?' 115
one 182
of 143
the 1
jury 138
asked. 90
`That 127
I 73
can't 141
remember,' 0
said 137
the 1
Hatter. 24
`You 23
MUST 49
remember,' 0
remarked 129
the 1
King, 77
`or 11
I'll 78
have 40
you 39
executed.' 176
The 49
miserable 6
Hatter 10
dropped 184
his 114
teacup 154
and 127
bread-and-butter, 153
and 127
went 116
down 170
on 151
one 182
knee. 195
`I'm 7
a 97
poor 18
man, 90
your 123
Majesty,' 44
he 125
began. 131
`You're 187
a 97
very 54
poor 18
speaker,' 126
said 137
the 1
King. 79
Here 48
one 182
of 143
the 1
guinea-pigs 53
cheered, 88
and 127
was 81
immediately 122
suppressed 148
by 159
the 1
officers 59
of 143
the 1
court. 173
(As 170
that 23
is 170
rather 0
a 97
hard 115
word, 98
I 73
will 90
just 164
explain 49
to 107
you 39
how 104
it 171
was 81
done. 188
They 40
had 51
a 97
large 43
canvas 80
bag, 172
which 141
tied 92
up 139
at 123
the 1
mouth 127
with 134
strings: 40
into 72
this 70
they 152
slipped 17
the 1
guinea-pig, 124
head 32
first, 60
and 127
then 141
sat 38
upon 130
it.) 198
`I'm 7
glad 168
I've 181
seen 67
that 23
done,' 91
thought 199
Alice. 54
`I've 197
so 76
often 30
read 142
in 165
the 1
newspapers, 62
at 123
the 1
end 171
of 143
trials, 161
"There 58
was 81
some 116
attempts 46
at 123
applause, 21
which 141
was 81
immediately 122
suppressed 148
by 159
the 1
officers 59
of 143
the 1
court," 169
and 127
I 73
never 44
understood 93
what 196
it 171
meant 23
till 117
now.' 135
`If 21
that's 69
all 73
you 39
know 107
about 69
it, 145
you 39
may 77
stand 198
down,' 123
continued 35
the 1
King. 79
`I 49
can't 141
go 104
no 121
lower,' 148
said 137
the 1
Hatter: 12
`I'm 7
on 151
the 1
floor, 176
as 122
it 171
is.' 35
`Then 45
you 39
may 77
SIT 110
down,' 123
the 1
King 143
replied. 115
Here 48
the 1
other 176
guinea-pig 120
cheered, 88
and 127
was 81
suppressed. 42
`Come, 168
that 23
finished 14
the 1
guinea-pigs!' 17
thought 199
Alice. 54
`Now 54
we 190
shall 52
get 30
on 151
better.' 17
`I'd 198
rather 0
finish 5
my 100
tea,' 147
said 137
the 1
Hatter, 26
with 134
an 117
anxious 161
look 47
at 123
the 1
Queen, 102
who 94
was 81
reading 36
the 1
list 14
of 143
singers. 135
`You 23
may 77
go,' 147
said 137
the 1
King, 77
and 127
the 1
Hatter 10
hurriedly 168
left 167
the 1
court, 175
without 8
even 130
waiting 165
to 107
put 175
his 114
shoes 96
on. 127
`--and 33
just 164
take 191
his 114
head 32
off 135
outside,' 64
the 1
Queen 50
added 168
to 107
one 182
of 143
the 1
officers: 5
but 121
the 1
Hatter 10
was 81
out 14
of 143
sight 93
before 89
the 1
officer 130
could 65
get 30
to 107
the 1
door. 152
`Call 86
the 1
next 107
witness!' 15
said 137
the 1
King. 79
The 49
next 107
witness 81
was 81
the 1
Duchess's 19
cook. 14
She 88
carried 154
the 1
pepper-box 64
in 165
her 189
hand, 165
and 127
Alice 168
guessed 30
who 94
it 171
was, 155
even 130
before 89
she 40
got 140
into 72
the 1
court, 175
by 159
the 1
way 87
the 1
people 81
near 192
the 1
door 126
began 49
sneezing 107
all 73
at 123
once. 157
`Give 41
your 123
evidence,' 190
said 137
the 1
King. 79
`Shan't,' 26
said 137
the 1
cook. 14
The 49
King 143
looked 98
anxiously 92
at 123
the 1
White 193
Rabbit, 118
who 94
said 137
in 165
a 97
low 148
voice, 78
`Your 27
Majesty 199
must 137
cross-examine 100
THIS 182
witness.' 18
`Well, 2
if 157
I 73
must, 91
I 73
must,' 36
the 1
King 143
said, 91
with 134
a 97
melancholy 190
air, 10
and, 181
after 140
folding 103
his 114
arms 175
and 127
frowning 144
at 123
the 1
cook 128
till 117
his 114
eyes 18
were 25
nearly 115
out 14
of 143
sight, 169
he 125
said 137
in 165
a 97
deep 4
voice, 78
`What 100
are 52
tarts 28
made 37
of?' 15
`Pepper, 98
mostly,' 109
said 137
the 1
cook. 14
`Treacle,' 29
said 137
a 97
sleepy 118
voice 154
behind 198
her. 105
`Collar 141
that 23
Dormouse,' 87
the 1
Queen 50
shrieked 7
out. 80
`Behead 75
that 23
Dormouse! 85
Turn 125
that 23
Dormouse 182
out 14
of 143
court! 186
Suppress 3
him! 181
Pinch 18
him! 181
Off 183
with 134
his 114
whiskers!' 156
For 25
some 116
minutes 55
the 1
whole 183
court 67
was 81
in 165
confusion, 46
getting 108
the 1
Dormouse 182
turned 108
out, 78
and, 181
by 159
the 1
time 141
they 152
had 51
settled 73
down 170
again, 100
the 1
cook 128
had 51
disappeared. 108
`Never 28
mind!' 160
said 137
the 1
King, 77
with 134
an 117
air 186
of 143
great 21
relief. 173
`Call 86
the 1
next 107
witness.' 18
And 175
he 125
added 168
in 165
an 117
undertone 70
to 107
the 1
Queen, 102
`Really, 71
my 100
dear, 186
YOU 63
must 137
cross-examine 100
the 1
next 107
witness. 3
It 179
quite 22
makes 189
my 100
forehead 188
ache!' 83
Alice 168
watched 6
the 1
White 193
Rabbit 110
as 122
he 125
fumbled 57
over 44
the 1
list, 78
feeling 132
very 54
curious 132
to 107
see 147
what 196
the 1
next 107
witness 81
would 85
be 139
like, 125
`--for 183
they 152
haven't 163
got 140
much 29
evidence 183
YET,' 75
she 40
said 137
to 107
herself. 107
Imagine 138
her 189
surprise, 27
when 114
the 1
White 193
Rabbit 110
read 142
out, 78
at 123
the 1
top 29
of 143
his 114
shrill 12
little 2
voice, 78
the 1
name 107
`Alice!' 182
CHAPTER 45
XII 104
Alice's 28
Evidence 111
`Here!' 46
cried 89
Alice, 52
quite 22
forgetting 141
in 165
the 1
flurry 70
of 143
the 1
moment 0
how 104
large 43
she 40
had 51
grown 107
in 165
the 1
last 126
few 72
minutes, 19
and 127
she 40
jumped 51
up 139
in 165
such 175
a 97
hurry 140
that 23
she 40
tipped 20
over 44
the 1
jury-box 152
with 134
the 1
edge 85
of 143
her 189
skirt, 135
upsetting 91
all 73
the 1
jurymen 60
on 151
to 107
the 1
heads 107
of 143
the 1
crowd 13
below, 45
and 127
there 196
they 152
lay 116
sprawling 185
about, 113
reminding 29
her 189
very 54
much 29
of 143
a 97
globe 101
of 143
goldfish 120
she 40
had 51
accidentally 97
upset 111
the 1
week 28
before. 153
`Oh, 123
I 73
BEG 36
your 123
pardon!' 128
she 40
exclaimed 144
in 165
a 97
tone 138
of 143
great 21
dismay, 85
and 127
began 49
picking 143
them 140
up 139
again 192
as 122
quickly 26
as 122
she 40
could, 37
for 177
the 1
accident 1
of 143
the 1
goldfish 120
kept 86
running 135
in 165
her 189
head, 36
and 127
she 40
had 51
a 97
vague 116
sort 86
of 143
idea 183
that 23
they 152
must 137
be 139
collected 145
at 123
once 81
and 127
put 175
back 111
into 72
the 1
jury-box, 28
or 155
they 152
would 85
die. 182
`The 185
trial 30
cannot 133
proceed,' 119
said 137
the 1
King 143
in 165
a 97
very 54
grave 13
voice, 78
`until 194
all 73
the 1
jurymen 60
are 52
back 111
in 165
their 130
proper 112
places-- 12
ALL,' 20
he 125
repeated 190
with 134
great 21
emphasis, 152
looking 187
hard 115
at 123
Alice 168
as 122
he 125
said 137
do. 187
Alice 168
looked 98
at 123
the 1
jury-box, 28
and 127
saw 41
that, 157
in 165
her 189
haste, 39
she 40
had 51
put 175
the 1
Lizard 162
in 165
head 32
downwards, 145
and 127
the 1
poor 18
little 2
thing 118
was 81
waving 34
its 16
tail 136
about 69
in 165
a 97
melancholy 190
way, 141
being 167
quite 22
unable 165
to 107
move. 165
She 88
soon 187
got 140
it 171
out 14
again, 100
and 127
put 175
it 171
right; 105
`not 3
that 23
it 171
signifies 85
much,' 24
she 40
said 137
to 107
herself; 94
`I 49
should 61
think 122
it 171
would 85
be 139
QUITE 62
as 122
much 29
use 103
in 165
the 1
trial 30
one 182
way 87
up 139
as 122
the 1
other.' 103
As 130
soon 187
as 122
the 1
jury 138
had 51
a 97
little 2
recovered 43
from 186
the 1
shock 26
of 143
being 167
upset, 11
and 127
their 130
slates 14
and 127
pencils 194
had 51
been 20
found 90
and 127
handed 114
back 111
to 107
them, 184
they 152
set 162
to 107
work 41
very 54
diligently 67
to 107
write 175
out 14
a 97
history 164
of 143
the 1
accident, 147
all 73
except 167
the 1
Lizard, 62
who 94
seemed 39
too 28
much 29
overcome 128
to 107
do 11
anything 54
but 121
sit 86
with 134
its 16
mouth 127
open, 138
gazing 86
up 139
into 72
the 1
roof 188
of 143
the 1
court. 173
`What 100
do 11
you 39
know 107
about 69
this 70
business?' 32
the 1
King 143
said 137
to 107
Alice. 54
`Nothing,' 176
said 137
Alice. 54
`Nothing 19
WHATEVER?' 54
persisted 27
the 1
King. 79
`Nothing 19
whatever,' 19
said 137
Alice. 54
`That's 51
very 54
important,' 157
the 1
King 143
said, 91
turning 115
to 107
the 1
jury. 124
They 40
were 25
just 164
beginning 115
to 107
write 175
this 70
down 170
on 151
their 130
slates, 14
when 114
the 1
White 193
Rabbit 110
interrupted: 0
`UNimportant, 85
your 123
Majesty 199
means, 170
of 143
course,' 98
he 125
said 137
in 165
a 97
very 54
respectful 1
tone, 122
but 121
frowning 144
and 127
making 45
faces 54
at 123
him 108
as 122
he 125
spoke. 174
`UNimportant, 85
of 143
course, 185
I 73
meant,' 98
the 1
King 143
hastily 4
said, 91
and 127
went 116
on 151
to 107
himself 32
in 165
an 117
undertone, 54
`important--unimportant-- 105
unimportant--important--' 182
as 122
if 157
he 125
were 25
trying 57
which 141
word 34
sounded 26
best. 106
Some 4
of 143
the 1
jury 138
wrote 141
it 171
down 170
`important,' 93
and 127
some 116
`unimportant.' 26
Alice 168
could 65
see 147
this, 14
as 122
she 40
was 81
near 192
enough 0
to 107
look 47
over 44
their 130
slates; 199
`but 57
it 171
doesn't 66
matter 23
a 97
bit,' 192
she 40
thought 199
to 107
herself. 107
At 131
this 70
moment 0
the 1
King, 77
who 94
had 51
been 20
for 177
some 116
time 141
busily 2
writing 132
in 165
his 114
note-book, 48
cackled 85
out 14
`Silence!' 111
and 127
read 142
out 14
from 186
his 114
book, 91
`Rule 164
Forty-two. 145
ALL 97
PERSONS 62
MORE 37
THAN 129
A 65
MILE 85
HIGH 178
TO 83
LEAVE 175
THE 25
COURT.' 148
Everybody 107
looked 98
at 123
Alice. 54
`I'M 175
not 67
a 97
mile 173
high,' 67
said 137
Alice. 54
`You 23
are,' 175
said 137
the 1
King. 79
`Nearly 5
two 76
miles 78
high,' 67
added 168
the 1
Queen. 100
`Well, 2
I 73
shan't 185
go, 68
at 123
any 148
rate,' 125
said 137
Alice: 66
`besides, 187
that's 69
not 67
a 97
regular 100
rule: 118
you 39
invented 105
it 171
just 164
now.' 135
`It's 159
the 1
oldest 25
rule 60
in 165
the 1
book,' 36
said 137
the 1
King. 79
`Then 45
it 171
ought 101
to 107
be 139
Number 119
One,' 33
said 137
Alice. 54
The 49
King 143
turned 108
pale, 42
and 127
shut 52
his 114
note-book 76
hastily. 90
`Consider 153
your 123
verdict,' 108
he 125
said 137
to 107
the 1
jury, 122
in 165
a 97
low, 32
trembling 2
voice. 76
`There's 176
more 125
evidence 183
to 107
come 60
yet, 12
please 142
your 123
Majesty,' 44
said 137
the 1
White 193
Rabbit, 118
jumping 156
up 139
in 165
a 97
great 21
hurry; 97
`this 86
paper 156
has 66
just 164
been 20
picked 112
up.' 44
`What's 104
in 165
it?' 123
said 137
the 1
Queen. 100
`I 49
haven't 163
opened 151
it 171
yet,' 11
said 137
the 1
White 193
Rabbit, 118
`but 57
it 171
seems 161
to 107
be 139
a 97
letter, 22
written 31
by 159
the 1
prisoner 40
to--to 2
somebody.' 41
`It 35
must 137
have 40
been 20
that,' 190
said 137
the 1
King, 77
`unless 94
it 171
was 81
written 31
to 107
nobody, 17
which 141
isn't 105
usual, 158
you 39
know.' 4
`Who 78
is 170
it 171
directed 8
to?' 19
said 137
one 182
of 143
the 1
jurymen. 150
`It 35
isn't 105
directed 8
at 123
all,' 156
said 137
the 1
White 193
Rabbit; 103
`in 21
fact, 48
there's 120
nothing 181
written 31
on 151
the 1
OUTSIDE.' 6
He 133
unfolded 119
the 1
paper 156
as 122
he 125
spoke, 176
and 127
added 168
`It 35
isn't 105
a 97
letter, 22
after 140
all: 121
it's 55
a 97
set 162
of 143
verses.' 9
`Are 36
they 152
in 165
the 1
prisoner's 44
handwriting?' 115
asked 160
another 173
of 143
the 1
jurymen. 150
`No, 179
they're 54
not,' 190
said 137
the 1
White 193
Rabbit, 118
`and 63
that's 69
the 1
queerest 96
thing 118
about 69
it.' 196
(The 89
jury 138
all 73
looked 98
puzzled.) 73
`He 189
must 137
have 40
imitated 7
somebody 86
else's 27
hand,' 142
said 137
the 1
King. 79
(The 89
jury 138
all 73
brightened 66
up 139
again.) 37
`Please 178
your 123
Majesty,' 44
said 137
the 1
Knave, 161
`I 49
didn't 156
write 175
it, 145
and 127
they 152
can't 141
prove 156
I 73
did: 163
there's 120
no 121
name 107
signed 12
at 123
the 1
end.' 196
`If 21
you 39
didn't 156
sign 173
it,' 134
said 137
the 1
King, 77
`that 39
only 180
makes 189
the 1
matter 23
worse. 30
You 87
MUST 49
have 40
meant 23
some 116
mischief, 62
or 155
else 145
you'd 188
have 40
signed 12
your 123
name 107
like 151
an 117
honest 9
man.' 91
There 124
was 81
a 97
general 48
clapping 74
of 143
hands 36
at 123
this: 28
it 171
was 81
the 1
first 32
really 77
clever 145
thing 118
the 1
King 143
had 51
said 137
that 23
day. 114
`That 127
PROVES 137
his 114
guilt,' 110
said 137
the 1
Queen. 100
`It 35
proves 145
nothing 181
of 143
the 1
sort!' 188
said 137
Alice. 54
`Why, 172
you 39
don't 136
even 130
know 107
what 196
they're 54
about!' 45
`Read 46
them,' 153
said 137
the 1
King. 79
The 49
White 193
Rabbit 110
put 175
on 151
his 114
spectacles. 55
`Where 113
shall 52
I 73
begin, 45
please 142
your 123
Majesty?' 55
he 125
asked. 90
`Begin 175
at 123
the 1
beginning,' 128
the 1
King 143
said 137
gravely, 2
`and 63
go 104
on 151
till 117
you 39
come 60
to 107
the 1
end: 159
then 141
stop.' 197
These 155
were 25
the 1
verses 122
the 1
White 193
Rabbit 110
read:-- 196
`They 56
told 75
me 80
you 39
had 51
been 20
to 107
her, 103
And 175
mentioned 183
me 80
to 107
him: 6
She 88
gave 49
me 80
a 97
good 85
character, 163
But 169
said 137
I 73
could 65
not 67
swim. 174
He 133
sent 152
them 140
word 34
I 73
had 51
not 67
gone 55
(We 38
know 107
it 171
to 107
be 139
true): 49
If 165
she 40
should 61
push 98
the 1
matter 23
on, 125
What 84
would 85
become 17
of 143
you? 72
I 73
gave 49
her 189
one, 86
they 152
gave 49
him 108
two, 0
You 87
gave 49
us 142
three 86
or 155
more; 134
They 40
all 73
returned 169
from 186
him 108
to 107
you, 53
Though 93
they 152
were 25
mine 35
before. 153
If 165
I 73
or 155
she 40
should 61
chance 156
to 107
be 139
Involved 183
in 165
this 70
affair, 5
He 133
trusts 13
to 107
you 39
to 107
set 162
them 140
free, 152
Exactly 60
as 122
we 190
were. 21
My 108
notion 43
was 81
that 23
you 39
had 51
been 20
(Before 49
she 40
had 51
this 70
fit) 24
An 125
obstacle 103
that 23
came 6
between 160
Him, 80
and 127
ourselves, 70
and 127
it. 147
Don't 64
let 35
him 108
know 107
she 40
liked 181
them 140
best, 104
For 25
this 70
must 137
ever 134
be 139
A 65
secret, 116
kept 86
from 186
all 73
the 1
rest, 40
Between 120
yourself 145
and 127
me.' 145
`That's 51
the 1
most 171
important 78
piece 38
of 143
evidence 183
we've 128
heard 126
yet,' 11
said 137
the 1
King, 77
rubbing 191
his 114
hands; 121
`so 132
now 70
let 35
the 1
jury--' 171
`If 21
any 148
one 182
of 143
them 140
can 56
explain 49
it,' 134
said 137
Alice, 52
(she 80
had 51
grown 107
so 76
large 43
in 165
the 1
last 126
few 72
minutes 55
that 23
she 40
wasn't 190
a 97
bit 149
afraid 161
of 143
interrupting 1
him,) 193
`I'll 94
give 137
him 108
sixpence. 11
_I_ 53
don't 136
believe 84
there's 120
an 117
atom 153
of 143
meaning 37
in 165
it.' 196
The 49
jury 138
all 73
wrote 141
down 170
on 151
their 130
slates, 14
`SHE 0
doesn't 66
believe 84
there's 120
an 117
atom 153
of 143
meaning 37
in 165
it,' 134
but 121
none 192
of 143
them 140
attempted 92
to 107
explain 49
the 1
paper. 14
`If 21
there's 120
no 121
meaning 37
in 165
it,' 134
said 137
the 1
King, 77
`that 39
saves 86
a 97
world 2
of 143
trouble, 77
you 39
know, 161
as 122
we 190
needn't 109
try 131
to 107
find 97
any. 34
And 175
yet 128
I 73
don't 136
know,' 66
he 125
went 116
on, 125
spreading 199
out 14
the 1
verses 122
on 151
his 114
knee, 193
and 127
looking 187
at 123
them 140
with 134
one 182
eye; 162
`I 49
seem 66
to 107
see 147
some 116
meaning 37
in 165
them, 184
after 140
all. 109
"--SAID 171
I 73
COULD 105
NOT 91
SWIM--" 54
you 39
can't 141
swim, 172
can 56
you?' 71
he 125
added, 44
turning 115
to 107
the 1
Knave. 159
The 49
Knave 61
shook 198
his 114
head 32
sadly. 109
`Do 75
I 73
look 47
like 151
it?' 123
he 125
said. 93
(Which 109
he 125
certainly 185
did 55
NOT, 65
being 167
made 37
entirely 170
of 143
cardboard.) 159
`All 57
right, 120
so 76
far,' 26
said 137
the 1
King, 77
and 127
he 125
went 116
on 151
muttering 157
over 44
the 1
verses 122
to 107
himself: 22
`"WE 176
KNOW 19
IT 147
TO 83
BE 115
TRUE--" 4
that's 69
the 1
jury, 122
of 143
course-- 61
"I 127
GAVE 161
HER 13
ONE, 30
THEY 64
GAVE 161
HIM 132
TWO--" 122
why, 68
that 23
must 137
be 139
what 196
he 125
did 55
with 134
the 1
tarts, 184
you 39
know--' 92
`But, 99
it 171
goes 190
on 151
"THEY 178
ALL 97
RETURNED 47
FROM 98
HIM 132
TO 83
YOU,"' 86
said 137
Alice. 54
`Why, 172
there 196
they 152
are!' 34
said 137
the 1
King 143
triumphantly, 181
pointing 26
to 107
the 1
tarts 28
on 151
the 1
table. 160
`Nothing 19
can 56
be 139
clearer 58
than 17
THAT. 31
Then 29
again--"BEFORE 129
SHE 64
HAD 75
THIS 182
FIT--" 121
you 39
never 44
had 51
fits, 82
my 100
dear, 186
I 73
think?' 166
he 125
said 137
to 107
the 1
Queen. 100
`Never!' 62
said 137
the 1
Queen 50
furiously, 160
throwing 52
an 117
inkstand 104
at 123
the 1
Lizard 162
as 122
she 40
spoke. 174
(The 89
unfortunate 125
little 2
Bill 167
had 51
left 167
off 135
writing 132
on 151
his 114
slate 57
with 134
one 182
finger, 173
as 122
he 125
found 90
it 171
made 37
no 121
mark; 46
but 121
he 125
now 70
hastily 4
began 49
again, 100
using 140
the 1
ink, 126
that 23
was 81
trickling 191
down 170
his 114
face, 183
as 122
long 12
as 122
it 171
lasted.) 144
`Then 45
the 1
words 169
don't 136
FIT 17
you,' 82
said 137
the 1
King, 77
looking 187
round 142
the 1
court 67
with 134
a 97
smile. 122
There 124
was 81
a 97
dead 68
silence. 61
`It's 159
a 97
pun!' 71
the 1
King 143
added 168
in 165
an 117
offended 21
tone, 122
and 127
everybody 21
laughed, 4
`Let 19
the 1
jury 138
consider 63
their 130
verdict,' 108
the 1
King 143
said, 91
for 177
about 69
the 1
twentieth 184
time 141
that 23
day. 114
`No, 179
no!' 143
said 137
the 1
Queen. 100
`Sentence 85
first--verdict 169
afterwards.' 132
`Stuff 100
and 127
nonsense!' 39
said 137
Alice 168
loudly. 143
`The 185
idea 183
of 143
having 99
the 1
sentence 195
first!' 98
`Hold 87
your 123
tongue!' 22
said 137
the 1
Queen, 102
turning 115
purple. 14
`I 49
won't!' 97
said 137
Alice. 54
`Off 119
with 134
her 189
head!' 82
the 1
Queen 50
shouted 0
at 123
the 1
top 29
of 143
her 189
voice. 76
Nobody 77
moved. 61
`Who 78
cares 106
for 177
you?' 71
said 137
Alice, 52
(she 80
had 51
grown 107
to 107
her 189
full 175
size 153
by 159
this 70
time.) 128
`You're 187
nothing 181
but 121
a 97
pack 185
of 143
cards!' 121
At 131
this 70
the 1
whole 183
pack 185
rose 111
up 139
into 72
the 1
air, 10
and 127
came 6
flying 97
down 170
upon 130
her: 117
she 40
gave 49
a 97
little 2
scream, 85
half 131
of 143
fright 122
and 127
half 131
of 143
anger, 27
and 127
tried 146
to 107
beat 102
them 140
off, 29
and 127
found 90
herself 33
lying 197
on 151
the 1
bank, 56
with 134
her 189
head 32
in 165
the 1
lap 107
of 143
her 189
sister, 176
who 94
was 81
gently 167
brushing 184
away 14
some 116
dead 68
leaves 196
that 23
had 51
fluttered 37
down 170
from 186
the 1
trees 117
upon 130
her 189
face. 185
`Wake 68
up, 153
Alice 168
dear!' 32
said 137
her 189
sister; 191
`Why, 172
what 196
a 97
long 12
sleep 47
you've 9
had!' 73
`Oh, 123
I've 181
had 51
such 175
a 97
curious 132
dream!' 57
said 137
Alice, 52
and 127
she 40
told 75
her 189
sister, 176
as 122
well 46
as 122
she 40
could 65
remember 35
them, 184
all 73
these 27
strange 44
Adventures 75
of 143
hers 174
that 23
you 39
have 40
just 164
been 20
reading 36
about; 98
and 127
when 114
she 40
had 51
finished, 90
her 189
sister 140
kissed 123
her, 103
and 127
said, 91
`It 35
WAS 105
a 97
curious 132
dream, 71
dear, 186
certainly: 117
but 121
now 70
run 91
in 165
to 107
your 123
tea; 83
it's 55
getting 108
late.' 169
So 84
Alice 168
got 140
up 139
and 127
ran 71
off, 29
thinking 80
while 17
she 40
ran, 45
as 122
well 46
she 40
might, 75
what 196
a 97
wonderful 122
dream 51
it 171
had 51
been. 66
But 169
her 189
sister 140
sat 38
still 32
just 164
as 122
she 40
left 167
her, 103
leaning 156
her 189
head 32
on 151
her 189
hand, 165
watching 75
the 1
setting 72
sun, 56
and 127
thinking 80
of 143
little 2
Alice 168
and 127
all 73
her 189
wonderful 122
Adventures, 25
till 117
she 40
too 28
began 49
dreaming 81
after 140
a 97
fashion, 4
and 127
this 70
was 81
her 189
dream:-- 121
First, 4
she 40
dreamed 26
of 143
little 2
Alice 168
herself, 109
and 127
once 81
again 192
the 1
tiny 192
hands 36
were 25
clasped 76
upon 130
her 189
knee, 193
and 127
the 1
bright 126
eager 176
eyes 18
were 25
looking 187
up 139
into 72
hers--she 150
could 65
hear 46
the 1
very 54
tones 193
of 143
her 189
voice, 78
and 127
see 147
that 23
queer 126
little 2
toss 107
of 143
her 189
head 32
to 107
keep 141
back 111
the 1
wandering 27
hair 50
that 23
WOULD 125
always 169
get 30
into 72
her 189
eyes--and 197
still 32
as 122
she 40
listened, 74
or 155
seemed 39
to 107
listen, 181
the 1
whole 183
place 167
around 107
her 189
became 71
alive 29
the 1
strange 44
creatures 68
of 143
her 189
little 2
sister's 176
dream. 69
The 49
long 12
grass 134
rustled 87
at 123
her 189
feet 190
as 122
the 1
White 193
Rabbit 110
hurried 83
by--the 34
frightened 154
Mouse 21
splashed 34
his 114
way 87
through 171
the 1
neighbouring 109
pool--she 4
could 65
hear 46
the 1
rattle 64
of 143
the 1
teacups 83
as 122
the 1
March 171
Hare 4
and 127
his 114
friends 115
shared 35
their 130
never-ending 168
meal, 89
and 127
the 1
shrill 12
voice 154
of 143
the 1
Queen 50
ordering 108
off 135
her 189
unfortunate 125
guests 69
to 107
execution--once 49
more 125
the 1
pig-baby 11
was 81
sneezing 107
on 151
the 1
Duchess's 19
knee, 193
while 17
plates 67
and 127
dishes 136
crashed 94
around 107
it--once 140
more 125
the 1
shriek 30
of 143
the 1
Gryphon, 143
the 1
squeaking 18
of 143
the 1
Lizard's 34
slate-pencil, 91
and 127
the 1
choking 193
of 143
the 1
suppressed 148
guinea-pigs, 41
filled 142
the 1
air, 10
mixed 195
up 139
with 134
the 1
distant 153
sobs 189
of 143
the 1
miserable 6
Mock 154
Turtle. 58
So 84
she 40
sat 38
on, 125
with 134
closed 132
eyes, 2
and 127
half 131
believed 88
herself 33
in 165
Wonderland, 22
though 61
she 40
knew 197
she 40
had 51
but 121
to 107
open 74
them 140
again, 100
and 127
all 73
would 85
change 32
to 107
dull 193
reality--the 183
grass 134
would 85
be 139
only 180
rustling 98
in 165
the 1
wind, 108
and 127
the 1
pool 12
rippling 19
to 107
the 1
waving 34
of 143
the 1
reeds--the 32
rattling 13
teacups 83
would 85
change 32
to 107
tinkling 152
sheep- 78
bells, 52
and 127
the 1
Queen's 154
shrill 12
cries 104
to 107
the 1
voice 154
of 143
the 1
shepherd 113
boy--and 85
the 1
sneeze 186
of 143
the 1
baby, 158
the 1
shriek 30
of 143
the 1
Gryphon, 143
and 127
all 73
the 1
other 176
queer 126
noises, 3
would 85
change 32
(she 80
knew) 148
to 107
the 1
confused 143
clamour 79
of 143
the 1
busy 41
farm-yard--while 88
the 1
lowing 10
of 143
the 1
cattle 129
in 165
the 1
distance 165
would 85
take 191
the 1
place 167
of 143
the 1
Mock 154
Turtle's 16
heavy 71
sobs. 105
Lastly, 121
she 40
pictured 186
to 107
herself 33
how 104
this 70
same 62
little 2
sister 140
of 143
hers 174
would, 17
in 165
the 1
after-time, 178
be 139
herself 33
a 97
grown 107
woman; 191
and 127
how 104
she 40
would 85
keep, 15
through 171
all 73
her 189
riper 126
years, 114
the 1
simple 126
and 127
loving 1
heart 142
of 143
her 189
childhood: 58
and 127
how 104
she 40
would 85
gather 61
about 69
her 189
other 176
little 2
children, 3
and 127
make 54
THEIR 170
eyes 18
bright 126
and 127
eager 176
with 134
many 167
a 97
strange 44
tale, 126
perhaps 119
even 130
with 134
the 1
dream 51
of 143
Wonderland 182
of 143
long 12
ago: 9
